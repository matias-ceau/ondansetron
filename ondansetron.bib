  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the parallel surge in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive alcohol management strategies. Low-dose ondansetron (AD04, a 5-HT3 antagonist) was shown recently to be a promising treatment for AUD with a specific genotypic profile (5-marker). The liver safety of AD04 has never been evaluated in subjects with AUD. The aim of the present study was to assess the liver safety profile of AD04 compared with placebo in subjects with AUD. METHODS: Liver biochemical parameters were assessed in subjects with AUD with a 5-marker genetic profile who participated in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial and received either twice-daily, low-dose AD04 (ondansetron 0.33 mg twice daily) or matching placebo, combined with brief psychosocial counseling. ALT, AST, GGT, Serum Bilirubin, MCV, and Prothrombin were evaluated at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Adverse cardiac events, general well-being, and study completion were also assessed. RESULTS: Low-dose AD04 did not significantly change biochemical markers of liver injury, such as ALT, AST, and Serum Bilirubin. While patients with AUD displayed elevated GGT levels, typically associated with increased alcohol consumption, this parameter remained unaffected by low-dose AD04. Notably, no significant adverse effects were observed due to oral low-dose AD04 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose AD04 has the potential to be a safe treatment option for subjects with AUD and ALD, indicating the need for an RCT for this specific cohort. Such a trial would pave the way for the design of a precision treatment for combined AUD with ALD.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently, we showed by using self-report that combining ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) and naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) was effective at reducing drinking and increasing abstinence among early-onset alcoholics (EOAs), who are characterized by a range of antisocial behaviors and high biological and familial disease predisposition. Here, we investigated whether the self-reported differences in drinking would be corroborated by measurements of serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) level, a sensitive, reliable, and well-validated marker of transient alcohol consumption. Method: An 8-week double-blind clinical trial was performed in which 20 EOAs were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) and naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) or placebo as an adjunct to weekly standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. Serum CDT was assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, and 8. Results: Log serum CDT was significantly lower in the ondansetron and naltrexone group (group mean, 1.44 Ϯ 0.076) compared with the placebo group (group mean, 1.82 Ϯ 0.113), as evidenced by a main effect of group [F(1,15) ϭ 7.2, p ϭ 0.017; effect size ϭ 0.32], visit [F(1,16) ϭ 11.2, p ϭ 0.004; effect size ϭ 0.41], and an interaction between group and visit [F(1,16) ϭ 27.54, p Ͻ 0.001; effect size ϭ 0.63]. Conclusions: The combination of ondansetron plus naltrexone was superior to placebo at reducing serum CDT. This corroborated our self-reported drinking data and demonstrated that the medication combination is an effective treatment for EOAs.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Previously, we have reported that the combination of ondansetron (a 5-HT3 antagonist) and naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) appears to act synergistically at improving the drinking outcomes of early onset alcoholics (EOA). a subtype of alcoholic characterized by developing problem-drinking earlier, antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and biological disease predisposition. Presumably, this medication combination counteracts the interaction between activated central 5-HT3 receptors and the endogenous opioid system during the mediation of alcohol-induced reward. We now hypothesize further that an important mechanism by which the combination diminishes alcohol consumption is through a reduction in craving. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the combination of naltrexone and ondansetron is superior to a placebo at reducing craving among EOA, and the relationship between craving and drinking behavior in both treatment groups. METHODS: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 10 EOA were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 microg/kg b.i.d.) + naltrexone (25 mg b.i.d.) and 10 EOA had a placebo (total n=20) as an adjunct to weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Craving was measured by using the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (OCDS). RESULTS: Craving ratings were scored on four subscales which where derived empirically by principal component structure analysis of the OCDS. EOA who received the medication combination, compared with the placebo, had significantly lower scores on "automaticity of drinking" and "alcohol consumption ". Reduction in automaticity of drinking was correlated with self-reported drinking for only the medication combination group. CONCLUSIONS: By reducing automaticity of drinking, the medication combination presumably decreased drinking salience and intensity. Larger scale studies testing these medications, both alone and together, among alcoholic subtypes are needed to establish and extend these promising findings.},

  abstract = {Multiple neurotransmitters in the mesocorticolimbic system that are involved in alcohol’s rewarding effects mediate its abuse liability. Abuse liability may be even more pronounced among biologic or early onset alcoholics—characterized by high familial loading and antisocial behaviors—because they may possess abnormalities of serotonin (5-HT) and perhaps μ-opioid function within the mesocorticolimbic system. Therefore, medications such as ondansetron and naltrexone, which target the 5-HT₃ and μ-opioid receptor systems, respectively, may each be beneficial for treating early onset alcoholism. Additionally, it would be tempting to hypothesize that the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone may be additive or synergistic in treating early onset alcoholism. The authors’ first study showed that ondansetron (1, 4, and 16 μg/kg twice daily) was more efficacious than placebo in treating early onset alcoholism. In a second smaller preliminary study, the authors found that the combination of ondansetron 4 μg/kg twice daily + naltrexone 25 mg twice daily, compared with placebo, appeared to act synergistically at improving the drinking outcomes of early onset alcoholics. That study did not, however, test the independent effects of ondansetron and naltrexone. The authors concluded that while ondansetron is effective at treating early onset alcoholism, its combination with naltrexone might be associated with greater treatment benefits. Further studies testing the factorial combinations of ondansetron and naltrexone are needed to establish synergism, or at least additivity, of effects in treating early onset alcoholism.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that functional control of the serotonergic system is regulated in part by differential expression of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT). Alcohol-dependent individuals with the LL/LS genotype (L-carriers), compared with those with the SS genotype, have a lower 5-HT neurotransmission, which we hypothesize would be associated with higher craving for alcohol among L-carriers. We hypothesize further that acute peripheral depletion of tryptophan (5-HT's precursor), while further reducing 5-HT function, might decrease auto-inhibition of 5-HT neuronal firing, thereby increasing 5-HT neurotransmission transiently and lowering alcohol craving. METHODS: We tested these hypotheses by examining whether in 34 Hispanic alcohol-dependent individuals subjective and physiological cue craving for alcohol differed by genotype, age of onset of problem drinking, and tryptophan availability. RESULTS: On subjective "urge to drink" and "crave for a drink," we found a significant (p {$<$} 0.05) main effect of genotype and cue, as well as an interaction among genotype, age of onset of problem drinking, and tryptophan depletion. For the physiological measure of pulse, there was a main effect of genotype. L-carriers had higher craving than their SS counterparts, an effect that decreased under tryptophan depletion. While craving in L-carriers increased with an earlier age of onset of problem drinking, the opposite effect was seen in those with the SS genotype. CONCLUSION: These results not only provide support for the hypothesis that alcoholics who are L-carriers have greater alcohol craving and possibly greater propensity for drinking but also propose that there is an important 5-HTT gene-by-environment interaction that alters cue craving response for alcohol.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: the 14-item Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) is a quick and reliable self-rating instrument that provides a total and two subscale scores that measure some cognitive aspects of alcohol "craving". This study validated further its utility as an alcoholism severity and treatment outcome instrument. METHODS: Alcoholism severity and analogue craving scales were administered at baseline, and the OCDS was given at baseline and weekly to 41 alcohol-dependent individuals who participated in a 12-week pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral treatment trial. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine group differences in the OCDS scores of those individuals who remained abstinent or drank during the trial. RESULTS: At baseline, the OCDS was correlated with the alcohol composite score of the addiction severity index (r=.48), the alcohol dependence scale (r=.42), the analogue craving measures (range r=.40 to .57), and prestudy alcohol consumption (r=.60). Most importantly the OCDS total and subscale scores were significantly different between individuals who had relapse drinking, who had "slip" drinking, and who remained abstinent, with relapsers showing the highest scores. CONCLUSIONS: The OCDS scores appear to be sensitive to alcoholism severity and change during abstinence and relapse drinking. Since the shared variance with analogue craving measures is only about 20\% to 30\%, it appears to be measuring a largely independent dimension of alcohol dependence. Its ease of use (5 minutes per self-rating), reliability, validity, and analytic capabilities support its utility as a tool to measure severity and improvement during alcoholism treatment trials.},

This article reviews pharmacotherapy for alcoholism with an emphasis on the perspective of the United States. The opiate antagonist naltrexone, the glutamate modulator acamprosate, and serotonergic agents will be highlighted in this review. In general, both naltrexone and acamprosate have been found in a number of studies to be efficacious agents for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not consistently shown to be efficacious but may be useful in certain subgroups of alcoholics. The serotonin type-3 antagonist, ondansetron, has shown promise in early-onset alcoholics but needs more extensive study.},

  abstract = {Repurposing drugs for the treatment of alcohol dependence involves the use of drugs that were initially developed for other conditions, but have shown promise in reducing alcohol use or preventing relapse. This approach can offer a more cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to developing new drugs from scratch. Currently approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) include acamprosate, disulfiram, naltrexone, nalmefene, baclofen, and sodium oxybate. Acamprosate was developed specifically for AUD, while disulfiram's alcohol-deterrent effects were discovered incidentally. Naltrexone and nalmefene were originally approved for opioids but found secondary applications in AUD. Baclofen and sodium oxybate were repurposed from neurological conditions. Other drugs show promise. Topiramate and zonisamide, anticonvulsants, demonstrate efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption. Another anticonvulsant, gabapentin has been disappointing overall, except in cases involving alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline, a nicotinic receptor agonist, benefits individuals with less severe AUD or concurrent nicotine use. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, has potential for early-onset AUD, especially when combined with naltrexone. Antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole and quetiapine have limited efficacy. Further investigation is needed for potential repurposing of α1 adrenergic receptor antagonists prazosin and doxazosin, glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ibudilast, the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine, and the OX1R and OX2R blocker Suvorexant. This review supports repurposing drugs as an effective strategy for expanding treatment options for AUD.},

  abstract = {An empirical clustering technique was applied to data obtained from 321 male and female alcoholics to identify homogeneous subtypes having discriminative and predictive validity. The clustering solution identified two “types” of alcoholics who differed consistently across 17 defining characteristics in the male and female samples. One group, designated type A alcoholics, is characterized by later onset, fewer childhood risk factors, less severe dependence, fewer alcohol-related problems, and less psychopathological dysfunction. The other group, termed type B alcoholics, is characterized by childhood risk factors, familial alcoholism, early onset of alcohol-related problems, greater severity of dependence, polydrug use, a more chronic treatment history (despite their younger age), greater psychopathological dysfunction, and more life stress. The two types also differed with respect to treatment outcome assessed prospectively at 12 and 36 months. The results are consistent with historical and contemporary typological theories that have postulated similar subgroups of alcoholics. The findings suggest that an empirically derived, multivariate typology of alcoholism has theoretical implications for explaining the heterogeneity among alcoholics and may provide a useful basis for predicting course and estimating treatment response.},

Despite the increase in the number of affected individuals, there are few effective pharmacological treatment options for substance use disorders. The study of the influence of an individual's genetic features on the treatment response may help to identify more efficacious treatment options. This systematic review focuses on the serotonergic system because of its relevant role in mood and impulse control disorders, and its contribution to the development and maintenance of drug use disorders. In particular, we examine the role of serotonergic genes in the response to pharmacotherapy for alcohol, cocaine and nicotine addiction. Current evidence suggests that genetic variability of the serotonergic biosynthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) genes mediates the efficacy of several addiction treatments, such as ondansetron and disulfiram, and the antidepressants bupropion, nortriptyline and sertraline.},

Currently, there is limited literature on the pharmacotherapeutic interventions for AUD in the Indian setting. It is imperative to identify the possible variations in their effects from Western studies, and hence the current review was attempted to perform a comprehensive evaluation and critical appraisal of the methodology of the evidence on pharmacological strategies of relapse prevention of AUD in the Indian setting. A total of 18 studies were included in the review. Disulfiram was the most common pharmacological agent to be studied. The initial literature before 2000 focused primarily on disulfiram, whereas the studies in the next decade compared it to acamprosate and naltrexone and emerging interest in anticraving agents such as baclofen and topiramate had been noted over the past few years. No studies were available on newer agents such as ondansetron, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or formulations such as depot and implants. Deterrent agents were found to be better when compared to anticraving agents in terms of abstinence and relapse, whereas the latter were more effective for control of craving. Among the pharmacological agents studied, the greatest evidence exists for disulfiram for relapse prevention which could be due to affordability of disulfiram and social support in the Indian context. The chief methodological limitations include the lack of randomized trials and objective measures for assessing abstinence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cocaine use disorder (CUD) has significant consequences and there remain no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies. Ondansetron is an indirect dopaminergic modulator that has shown efficacy in alcohol use disorder, particularly in phenotypic and genotypic subgroups, and was found to be efficacious in a pilot dose-finding trial for CUD. METHODS: One-hundred eight (108) adults with CUD were randomized to ondansetron 4~mg twice daily or placebo for 9 weeks and assessed up to thrice weekly to evaluate self-reported cocaine use and urine benzoylecgonine. Participants received cognitive-behavioral therapy and brief behavioral compliance enhancement therapy. Consenting participants (N~=~79) provided blood samples for exploratory pharmacogenetic analyses. RESULTS: Participants in both arms reduced cocaine use over time, but there was no statistically significant difference on percentage of cocaine-free days (PCFD; p~=~0.972) or percentage of cocaine-free urine samples (PCFU; p~=~0.909). Participants with early-onset CUD had greater improvement regardless of study arm (p~=~0.002). Post hoc pharmacogenetic analyses demonstrated an interaction effect between treatment and rs1176713 SNP on PCFU in the total sample (p~=~0.040) and African ancestry subset (p~=~0.03). Constipation, fatigue, and somnolence were more common among ondansetron-treated participants (Fisher exact p~{$<~$}0.05). Those who developed constipation were mostly rs1176713:GG carriers (Fisher exact p~=~0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron did not demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of CUD. However, these preliminary results suggest a genotype-based variance in response to ondansetron in African ancestry individuals with CUD. Further studies are needed to validate findings for developing a personalized genomic approach for CUD treatment in racially and ethnically diverse populations.},

The SAEM GRACE-4 Writing Team reached the following recommendations: (1) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with moderate to severe AWS who are being admitted to hospital, we suggest using phenobarbital in addition to benzodiazepines compared to using benzodiazepines alone [low to very low certainty of evidence]; (2) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD who desire alcohol cessation, we suggest a prescription for one anticraving medication [very low certainty of evidence]; (2a) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD, we suggest naltrexone (compared to no prescription) to prevent return to heavy drinking [low certainty of evidence]; (2b) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD and contraindications to naltrexone, we suggest acamprosate (compared to no prescription) to prevent return to heavy drinking and/or to reduce heavy drinking [low certainty of evidence]; (2c) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) with AUD, we suggest gabapentin (compared to no prescription) for the management of AUD to reduce heavy drinking days and improve alcohol withdrawal symptoms [very low certainty of evidence]; (3a) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) presenting to the ED with CHS we suggest the use of haloperidol or droperidol (in addition to usual care/serotonin antagonists, e.g., ondansetron) to help with symptom management [very low certainty of evidence]; and (3b) in adult ED patients (over the age of 18) presenting to the ED with CHS, we also suggest offering the use of topical capsaicin (in addition to usual care/serotonin antagonists, e.g., ondansetron) to help with symptom management [very low certainty of evidence].},

  abstract = {Bipolar disorder is associated with high rates of alcohol use disorder. However, little is known about the treatment of this dual diagnosis population. Previous studies suggest that ondansetron decreases alcohol use, particularly in people with specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ondansetron was conducted in 70 outpatients with bipolar spectrum disorders and early onset alcohol use disorder. Outcome measures included alcohol use, assessed with the Timeline Followback method, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-report, and Young Mania Rating Scale. SNPs rs1042173, rs1176713 and rs1150226 were explored as predictors of response. Participants had a mean age of 44.9 ± 9.4 years, were mostly men (60.0\%), and African American (51.4\%). Mean ondansetron exit dose was 3.23 ± 2.64~mg. No significant between-group differences in alcohol use measures were observed. However, a significant reduction in HRSD scores was observed (p~=~0.045). Inclusion of SNPs increased effect sizes for some alcohol-related outcomes and the HRSD. Ondansetron was well tolerated. This proof-of-concept study is the first report on ondansetron in bipolar people with bipolar disorders and alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use did not demonstrate a significant between-group difference. However, the findings suggest that ondansetron may be associated with reduction in depressive symptom severity in persons with bipolar illnesses and alcohol use disorder. A larger trial is needed to examine the effects of ondansetron on bipolar depression.},

  abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent but severely under-treated disorder, with only three widely-approved pharmacotherapies. Given that AUD is a very heterogeneous disorder, it is unlikely that one single medication will be effective for all individuals with an AUD. As such, there is a need to develop new, more effective, and diverse pharmacological treatment options for AUD with the hopes of increasing utilization and improving care. In this qualitative literature review, we discuss the efficacy, mechanism of action, and tolerability of approved, repurposed, and novel pharmacotherapies for the treatment of AUD with a clinical perspective. Pharmacotherapies discussed include: disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, nalmefene, topiramate, gabapentin, varenicline, baclofen, sodium oxybate, aripiprazole, ondansetron, mifepristone, ibudilast, suvorexant, prazosin, doxazosin, N-acetylcysteine, GET73, ASP8062, ABT-436, PF-5190457, and cannabidiol. Overall, many repurposed and novel agents discussed in this review demonstrate clinical effectiveness and promise for the future of AUD treatment. Importantly, these medications also offer potential improvements towards the advancement of precision medicine and personalized treatment for the heterogeneous AUD population. However, there remains a great need to improve access to treatment, increase the menu of approved pharmacological treatments, and de-stigmatize and increase treatment-seeking for AUD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Only a few pharmacological treatments are available for treating alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and nalmefene is EMA-approved in European Union. Off-label medications, such as baclofen, gabapentin, ondansetron and topiramate are medications commonly prescribed for the treatment of AUD. The aim of this review is to give an update on recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reviews evaluating pharmacological treatment for AUD. RECENT FINDINGS: A literature search was conducted for pharmacological treatment for alcohol use disorder, published from January 2017 to January 2019. An additional search from two ongoing-study databases was performed. A total of 13 studies, 11 reviews and 7 on-going clinical trials were identified. Interest in studying baclofen as a treatment for AUD was greater compared with other medications, yet with inconclusive results. Three new RCTs of first-line medication naltrexone showed reduction in drinking. SUMMARY: Three new published RCTs focus on baclofen and naltrexone. These results are consistent with old findings demonstrating that naltrexone reduces heavy drinking. Several RCT on baclofen do not support the use of baclofen for treatment of AUD. Encouraging results have been reported for topiramate, gabapentin and also varenicline, which might be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence.},

  abstract = {The chemistry, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, stability, compatibility, and dosage of ondansetron hydrochloride are described, and clinical studies of the use of ondansetron for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic therapy are reviewed. Ondansetron hydrochloride is a specific antagonist of serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptors, both in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and in the GI tract. Peak plasma concentrations of ondansetron occur approximately one hour after an oral dose and 6 to 20 minutes after an i.v. dose. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 3.5 hours in healthy volunteers, but it is extended in elderly patients (mean of 7.9 hours). In clinical trials, ondansetron has been shown to provide excellent control of nausea and vomiting in patients treated with cisplatin. Comparisons of ondansetron with metoclopramide in patients treated with various types of chemotherapy have shown better response rates with ondansetron. Ondansetron has also been shown to be effective in controlling nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cyclophosphamide with an anthracycline and in patients receiving combination therapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Adverse effects appear to be mild and include headache, constipation, diarrhea and transient abnormalities in liver function tests. The dose of ondansetron (as the hydrochloride salt) for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults is 0.15 mg/kg i.v. every four hours for three doses, beginning 30 minutes before antineoplastic therapy. The efficacy of ondansetron is comparable to that of metoclopramide, and the adverse-effect profile is much less problematic. The cost of ondansetron is much higher than that of metoclopramide; thus its use should be limited to patients at high risk for metoclopramide-induced adverse effects and patients in whom metoclopramide is ineffective.},

  abstract = {Background: Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed for chronic pain. One expected consequence of long-term opioid use is the development of physical dependence. Although previous resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have demonstrated signal changes in reward-associated areas following morphine administration, the effects of acute withdrawal on the human brain have been less well-investigated. In an earlier study by our laboratory, ondansetron was shown to be effective in preventing symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. The purpose of this current study was to characterize neural activity associated with acute opioid withdrawal and examine whether these changes are modified by ondansetron. Methods: Ten participants were enrolled in this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study and attended three acute opioid withdrawal sessions. Participants received either placebo or ondansetron (8 Ymg IV) before morphine administration (10 Ymg/70 Ykg IV). Participants then underwent acute naloxone-precipitated withdrawal during a resting state fMRI scan. Objective and subjective opioid withdrawal symptoms were assessed. Results: Imaging results showed that naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal was associated with increased neural activity in several reward processing regions, including the right pregenual cingulate, putamen, and bilateral caudate, and decreased neural activity in networks involved in sensorimotor integration. Ondansetron pretreatment did not have a significant effect on the imaging correlates of opioid withdrawal. Conclusions: This study presents a preliminary investigation of the regional changes in neural activity during acute opioid withdrawal. The fMRI acute opioid withdrawal model may serve as a tool for studying opioid dependence and withdrawal in human participants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Patients were titrated onto sustained-release oral morphine and randomized to take 8 mg ondansetron or placebo three times daily concurrently with morphine during the 30-day titration. Following titration, patients underwent Naloxone induced opioid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms were then assessed by a blinded research assistant (objective opioid withdrawal score: OOWS) and by the research participant (subjective opioid withdrawal score: SOWS). Results: We observed clinically significant signs of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal in all participants (ΔOOWS = 4.3 ± 2.4, p {$<$} 0.0001; ΔSOWS = 14.1 ± 11.7, p {$<$} 0.0001), however no significant differences in withdrawal scores were detected between treatment groups. Conclusion: We hypothesized that ondansetron would prevent the development of physical dependence in human subjects when co-administered with opioids, but found no difference in naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal scores between ondansetron and placebo treatment groups. These results suggest that further studies are needed to determine if 5HT3 receptor antagonists are useful in preventing opioid physical dependence.

Three dimensions of personality are defined in terms of the basic stimulus-response characteristics of novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence. The possible underlying genetic and neuroanatomical bases of observed variation in these dimensions are reviewed and considered in relation to adaptive responses to environmental challenge. The functional interaction of these dimensions leads to integrated patterns of differential response to novelty, punishment, and reward. The possible tridimensional combinations of extreme (high or low) variants on these basic stimulus-response characteristics correspond closely to traditional descriptions of personality disorders. This reconciles dimensional and categorical approaches to personality description. It also implies that the underlying structure of normal adaptive traits is the same as that of maladaptive personality traits, except for schizotypal and paranoid disorders.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pharmacogenetic studies of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have suggested that the efficacy of treatments for AUD is, in part, influenced by the genetic background of an individual. Since the frequency of alleles associated with pharmacotherapy for AUD varies by ancestral background, the effectiveness of medications used to treat AUD may vary among different populations. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing pharmacogenetic studies of treatments for AUD in individuals of European, East Asian, African, and American Indian/Alaska Native ancestry. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for pharmacogenetic studies of AUD treatment that included individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds. RESULTS: Pharmacogenetic studies of AUD reviewed here have primarily investigated genetic variation thought to play a role in the response to naltrexone, ondansetron, and topiramate. There is support that the A118G polymorphism should be further investigated in individuals of East Asian ancestry. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Given the lack of pharmacogenetic research on response to AUD medication in ethnic minority populations and the mixed results, there is a critical need for future studies among individuals of different ancestries. More efforts should be devoted to standardizing procedures such that results can be more readily integrated into a body of literature that can directly inform clinical practice. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlights the importance for future research to aim for inclusiveness in pharmacogenetic studies of AUD and increase diversity of clinical trials in order to provide the best treatment outcomes for individuals across different racial and ethnic groups.

This matched case-control study investigates the effect of a multidisciplinary criteria-led discharge protocol for uncomplicated appendicitis in children. METHODS: Key protocol components included limiting post-operative antibiotics to two intravenous doses, avoidance of intravenous opioid analgesia, prompt resumption of diet, active encouragement of early ambulation and nursing staff autonomy to discharge patients that met assigned criteria. The study period was from August 2015 to February 2016. Outcomes were compared with a historical control group matched for operative approach. RESULTS: Outcomes for 83 patients enrolled to our protocol were compared with those of 83 controls. There was a 29.2\% reduction in median post-operative length of stay in our protocol-based care group (19.6 versus 27.7 h; P {$<$} 0.001). The rate of discharges within 24 h improved from 12 to 42\%. There was no significant difference in complication rate (4.8 versus 7.2\%; P = 0.51). Mean oral morphine dose equivalent per kilogram requirement was less than half (46\%) that of control group patients (P {$<$} 0.001). Mean number of ondansetron doses was also significantly lower. Projected annual direct cost savings following protocol implementation was AUD\$77 057. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a criteria-led discharge protocol at our hospital decreased length of stay, reduced variation in care, preserved existing low morbidity, incurred substantial cost savings, and safely rationalized opioid and antiemetic medication. These protocols are inexpensive and offer tangible benefits that are accessible to all health care settings.},

  abstract = {Recently, we reported that ondansetron (a 5-HT3 antagonist) as an adjunct to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produced significant within-group decreases (improvement) in drinking in adolescents with alcohol dependence. We previously have hypothesized that the mechanism of ondansetron treatment response in adolescents with alcohol dependence should be similar to early onset adult alcoholics, wherein blockade of serotonin-3 receptors may decrease dopamine release and subsequent alcohol consumption and craving. We now suggest that one mechanism by which ondansetron diminishes drinking in adolescents with alcohol dependence is through a reduction in "craving" as measured by the Adolescent Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (A-OCDS). We conducted an 8-week, prospective, open-label study of ondansetron (4 microg/kg b.i.d.) in 12 adolescents (age 14-20 years) who had alcohol dependence. Results showed that "irresistibility" and total scores as measured by the A-OCDS were correlated significantly with drinking indices (drinks/day, percent days abstinent) at the end of treatment, and that "irresistibility" and total A-OCDS scores decreased significantly by the end of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the A-OCDS can be useful as an outcome measure in clinical studies of adolescents with alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {The effect of various drugs on the extracellular concentration of dopamine in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens septi (a limbic area) and the dorsal caudate nucleus (a subcortical motor area), was studied in freely moving rats by using brain dialysis. Drugs abused by humans (e.g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused.},

  abstract = {Harmful alcohol use is a risk factor in more than 60 diseases and injuries resulting in approximately 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide. In the United States (US) and Europe, there are only a few medications approved for alcohol dependence (AD) however, these medications have only been moderately effective and there is a crucial need for more effective treatments. This review briefly summarizes research on currently approved medications for AD, as well as promising medications like topiramate, baclofen and ondansetron. Topiramate is likely the most promising new treatment for AD, however, further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and appropriate length of treatment. Baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, is a promising medication as a treatment for AD, especially for patients with AD and severe liver disease. Ondansetron has shown promising results as a potential medication for AD, but only within a certain subtype of individuals. This review also discusses more recent findings on other potential pharmacotherapies for AD, such as serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; i.e. sertraline), aripiprazole and prazosin, as well as on some examples of other potentially interesting new neuropharmacological targets (i.e. cannabinoid receptors, CRF, NPY, ghrelin). Finally, the present review also discusses the attempts to personalize medication for AD treatment by alcohol typology and pharmacogenetics.},

FDA-approved medications are available for alcohol, nicotine, and opiate addiction but not for stimulants or cannabis addictions. The focus of this chapter is on the medications to treat illicit substances, mainly heroin, stimulants, and cannabis. Currently, psychotherapy is still the primary mode of treatment for stimulants and cannabis addiction; however, relapse rates remain high. The search for effective pharmacological treatments has yielded some positive signals in proof of concept trials. Medications that are being tested in confirmatory trials for stimulants addiction include bupropion, topiramate, modafinil, disulfiram, ondansetron, and methylphenidate. For cannabis addiction there have been proof of concept trials that have shown efficacy, such as buspirone, nefazadone, and marinol. Early preclinical and clinical data suggest that some new molecular entities would be promising for multiple addictions, e.g., CBl antagonists, D3 partial agonists, and CRF antagonists.

  abstract = {The 5-HT3 receptor is rapidly potentiated by ethanol and mediates fast excitatory serotonin (5-HT) transmission that modulates dopamine release in the reward circuitry. The 5-HT transporter regulates synaptic 5-HT availability. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter and receptor may therefore influence addiction vulnerability. In this study, 360 treatment-seeking African American male patients with single and comorbid DSM-IV lifetime diagnoses of alcohol, cocaine and heroin dependence and 187 African American male controls were genotyped for the triallelic 5-HTTLPR functional polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter gene (SLC6A4) and 16 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across HTR3B (including the functional rs1176744 Tyr129Ser) and HTR3A, genes encoding 5-HT3 receptors. The HTR3B rs1176744 gain-of-function Ser129 allele predicted alcohol dependence (P=0.002) and low 5-HTTLPR activity predicted cocaine/heroin dependence (P=0.01). Both the HTR3B Ser129 allele (P=0.014, odds ratio (OR)=1.7 (1.1-2.6)) and low 5-HTTLPR activity (P=0.011, OR=2.5 (1.3-4.6)) were more common in men with alcohol+drug dependence compared with controls. Moreover, the HTR3B Ser129 allele and low 5-HTTLPR activity had an additive (but not an interactive) effect on alcohol+drug dependence (OR=6.0 (2.1-16.6)) that accounted for 13\% of the variance. One possible explanation of our findings is that increased synaptic 5-HT coupled with increased 5-HT3 receptor responsiveness may result in enhanced dopamine transmission in the reward pathway, a predictor of increased risk for addiction. Our results may have pharmacogenetic implications for 5-HT3 therapeutic antagonists such as ondansetron.},

  abstract = {Although very many individuals drink alcohol at safe levels, a significant proportion escalates their consumption with addiction as the end result. Alcoholism is a common, moderately heritable, psychiatric disorder that is accompanied by considerable morbidity and mortality. Variation in clinical presentation suggests inter-individual variation in mechanisms of vulnerability including genetic risk factors. The development of addiction is likely to involve numerous functional genetic variants of small effects. The first part of this review will focus on genetic factors underlying inter-individual variability in response to alcohol consumption, including variants in alcohol metabolizing genes that produce an aversive response (the flushing syndrome) and variants that predict the level of subjective and physiological response to alcohol. The second part of this review will report on genetic variants that identify subgroups of alcoholics who are more likely to respond to pharmacotherapy to reduce levels of drinking or maintain abstinence. Genetic analyses of the level of response to alcohol, particularly of the functional OPRM1 A118G polymorphism and 5' and 3' functional polymorphisms in SLC6A4, are beginning to provide insights into the etiology of alcoholism and also genotype-stratified subgroup responses to naltrexone and SSRIs/ondansetron respectively. Because of large inter-ethnic variation in allele frequencies, the relevance of these functional polymorphisms will vary between ethnic groups. However there are relatively few published studies in this field, particularly with large sample sizes in pharmacogenetic studies, therefore it is premature to draw any conclusions at this stage.},

  abstract = {The ability of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists to block the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol was investigated in pigeons trained with food reinforcement to discriminate ethanol (1.5 g/kg; IG) from water. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists that are substituted tropines, ICS 205-930 (0.1–0.56 mg/kg) and MDL 72222 (3.0–17.0 mg/kg), blocked ethanol-appropriate responding, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that some of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol are mediated via the 5-HT3 receptor. The blockade the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol occurred in the presence of approximately 25–40 mM blood ethanol levels. Furthermore, the ethanol dose-effect function was shifted to the right by increasing doses of MDL 72222, suggesting a surmountable antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. However, the benzamide zacopride (0.56–1.7 mg/kg), which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, did not block the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. In addition, the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin also failed to block the ethanol discrimination. The results suggest that 5-HT3 mediated neurotransmission is an important component of ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects, but that the structural characteristics of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists influence their ability to block this action of ethanol. Furthermore, these findings implicate a significant role of 5-HT3 activity in the behavioral effects of ethanol that may provide a pharmacological means for therapeutic intervention of alcohol abuse.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Harmful alcohol use is defined as unhealthy alcohol use that results in adverse physical, psychological, social, or societal consequences and is among the leading risk factors for disease, disability and premature mortality globally. The burden of harmful alcohol use is increasing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and there remains a large unmet need for indicated prevention and treatment interventions to reduce harmful alcohol use in these settings. Evidence regarding which interventions are effective and feasible for addressing harmful and other patterns of unhealthy alcohol use in LMICs is limited, which contributes to this gap in services. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of psychosocial and pharmacologic treatment and indicated prevention interventions compared with control conditions (wait list, placebo, no treatment, standard care, or active control condition) aimed at reducing harmful alcohol use in LMICs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indexed in the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, the Cochrane Clinical Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) through 12 December 2021. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Web of Science, and Opengrey database to identify unpublished or ongoing studies. We searched the reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles for eligible studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All RCTs comparing an indicated prevention or treatment intervention (pharmacologic or psychosocial) versus a control condition for people with harmful alcohol use in LMICs were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 66 RCTs with 17,626 participants. Sixty-two of these trials contributed to the meta-analysis. Sixty-three studies were conducted in middle-income countries (MICs), and the remaining three studies were conducted in low-income countries (LICs). Twenty-five trials exclusively enrolled participants with alcohol use disorder. The remaining 51 trials enrolled participants with harmful alcohol use, some of which included both cases of alcohol use disorder and people reporting hazardous alcohol use patterns that did not meet criteria for disorder. Fifty-two RCTs assessed the efficacy of psychosocial interventions; 27 were brief interventions primarily based on motivational interviewing and were compared to brief advice, information, or assessment only. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to brief interventions given the high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Studies reporting continuous outcomes: Tau² = 0.15, Q =139.64, df =16, P{$<$}.001, I² = 89\%, 3913 participants, 17 trials, very low certainty; Studies reporting dichotomous outcomes: Tau²=0.18, Q=58.26, df=3, P{$<$}.001, I² =95\%, 1349 participants, 4 trials, very low certainty). The other types of psychosocial interventions included a range of therapeutic approaches such as behavioral risk reduction, cognitive-behavioral therapy, contingency management, rational emotive therapy, and relapse prevention. These interventions were most commonly compared to usual care involving varying combinations of psychoeducation, counseling, and pharmacotherapy. We are uncertain whether a reduction in harmful alcohol use is attributable to psychosocial treatments due to high levels of heterogeneity among included studies (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 1.15; Q = 444.32, df = 11, P{$<$}.001; I²=98\%, 2106 participants, 12 trials, very low certainty). Eight trials compared combined pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions with placebo, psychosocial intervention alone, or another pharmacologic treatment. The active pharmacologic study conditions included disulfiram, naltrexone, ondansetron, or topiramate. The psychosocial components of these interventions included counseling, encouragement to attend Alcoholics Anonymous, motivational interviewing, brief cognitive-behavioral therapy, or other psychotherapy (not specified). Analysis of studies comparing a combined pharmacologic and psychosocial intervention to psychosocial intervention alone found that the combined approach may be associated with a greater reduction in harmful alcohol use (standardized mean difference (standardized mean difference (SMD))=-0.43, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -0.61 to -0.24; 475 participants; 4 trials; low certainty). Four trials compared pharmacologic intervention alone with placebo and three with another pharmacotherapy. Drugs assessed were: acamprosate, amitriptyline, baclofen disulfiram, gabapentin, mirtazapine, and naltrexone. None of these trials evaluated the primary clinical outcome of interest, harmful alcohol use. ~ Thirty-one trials reported rates of retention in the intervention. Meta-analyses revealed that rates of retention between study conditions did not differ in any of the comparisons (pharmacologic risk ratio (RR) = 1.13, 95\% CI: 0.89 to 1.44, 247 participants, 3 trials, low certainty; pharmacologic in addition to psychosocial intervention: RR = 1.15, 95\% CI: 0.95 to 1.40, 363 participants, 3 trials, moderate certainty). Due to high levels of heterogeneity, we did not calculate pooled estimates comparing retention in brief (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; Q = 172.59, df = 11, P{$<$}.001; I2 = 94\%; 5380 participants; 12 trials, very low certainty) or other psychosocial interventions (Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; Q = 34.07, df = 8, P{$<$}.001; I2 = 77\%; 1664 participants; 9 trials, very low certainty). Two pharmacologic trials and three combined pharmacologic and psychosocial trials reported on side effects. These studies found more side effects attributable to amitriptyline relative to mirtazapine, naltrexone and topiramate relative to placebo, yet no differences in side effects between placebo and either acamprosate or ondansetron. Across all intervention types there was substantial risk of bias. Primary threats to validity included lack of blinding and differential/high rates of attrition. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In LMICs there is low-certainty evidence supporting the efficacy of combined psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use relative to psychosocial interventions alone. There is insufficient evidence to determine the efficacy of pharmacologic or psychosocial interventions on reducing harmful alcohol use largely due to the substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, comparisons, and interventions that precluded pooling of these data in meta-analyses. The majority of studies are brief interventions, primarily among men, and using measures that have not been validated in the target population. Confidence in these results is reduced by the risk of bias and significant heterogeneity among studies as well as the heterogeneity of results on different outcome measures within studies. More evidence on the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions, specific types of psychosocial interventions are needed to increase the certainty of these results.},

Examples include monthly medical costs, daily alcohol drinks, relative abundance of microbiome, etc. With the advance of information technology for data collection and storage, the number of variables available to researchers can be rather large in such studies. To avoid curse of dimensionality and facilitate decision making, it is critically important to select covariates that are truly related to the outcome. However, owing to its intricate nature, there is not yet a satisfactory variable selection method available for such sophisticated models. In this paper, we seek a feasible way of conducting variable selection for random effects two-part models on the basis of the recently proposed "minimum information criterion" (MIC) method. We demonstrate that the MIC formulation leads to a reasonable formulation of sparse estimation, which can be conveniently solved with SAS Proc NLMIXED. The performance of our approach is evaluated through simulation, and an application to a longitudinal alcohol dependence study is provided.},

  abstract = {Recently, research on alcohol dependence has examined the role of motivation and readiness to change in the treatment process. The purpose of this study is to explore the relation between stage of change and drinking outcome variables across treatment. The proposed study is based on a sample of 124 participants that were entered into a one week lead-in single-blind placebo period followed by 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment. The clinical trial examined the use of ondansetron (Zofran), a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, in reducing drinking outcomes. Drinking behavior was assessed using a timeline follow-back procedure. This self-report drinking data was used to calculate drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent. During the study, participants also completed the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment Scale (URICA), a Stages of Change (SOC) questionnaire which is designed to assess one's commitment to change. The SOC questionnaire was completed at the following intervals: intake, 1st week of study, 4th week of study, 8th week of study, and 12th week of study. The study examined the relation between stage of change and drinking outcome variables across treatment. Results concluded that persons with higher readiness scores at baseline had lower reported amounts of drinking throughout the treatment phase. In addition, persons with lower readiness scores at baseline had higher reported amounts of drinking across the treatment phase. Baseline SOC readiness was also correlated with the amount of alcohol abstinence during the middle phase and at the conclusion of the study. Additional results of the study suggest that differences were not significant between the individual participants or between the different treatment samples on the following variables: the interaction between time and onset, the interaction between time and dose, and the interaction between time, onset, and dose. Regardless of treatment completion, participants did not differ in their reported SOC scores during the trial. In addition, drinking outcomes, age of onset and medication dosage were not related to the SOC score, either at baseline or throughout the trial. Overall, measures of readiness to change based on the URICA exhibited limited clinical utility. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Opioids are powerful analgesic drugs that are used clinically to treat pain. However, chronic opioid use causes compensatory neuroadaptations that result in greater pain sensitivity during withdrawal, known as opioid withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia (OWIH). Cold nociception tests are commonly used in humans, but preclinical studies often use mechanical and heat stimuli to measure OWIH. Thus, further characterization of cold nociception stimuli is needed in preclinical models. We assessed three cold nociception tests-thermal gradient ring (5-30~°C, 5-50~°C, 15-40~°C, and 25-50~°C), dynamic cold plate (4~°C to -1~°C at -1~°C/min, -1~°C to 4~°C at +1~°C/min), and stable cold plate (10~°C, 6~°C, and 2~°C)-to measure hyperalgesia in a mouse protocol of heroin dependence. On the thermal gradient ring, mice in the heroin withdrawal group preferred warmer temperatures, and the results depended on the ring's temperature range. On the dynamic cold plate, heroin withdrawal increased the number of nociceptive responses, with a temperature ramp from 4~°C to -1~°C yielding the largest response. On the stable cold plate, heroin withdrawal increased the number of nociceptive responses, and a plate temperature of 2~°C yielded the most significant increase in responses. Among the three tests, the stable cold plate elicited the most robust change in behavior between heroin-dependent and nondependent mice and had the highest throughput. To pharmacologically characterize the stable cold plate test, we used μ-opioid and non-opioid receptor-targeting drugs that have been previously shown to reverse OWIH in mechanical and heat nociception assays. The full μ-opioid receptor agonist methadone and μ-opioid receptor partial agonist buprenorphine decreased OWIH, whereas the preferential μ-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone increased OWIH. Two N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists (ketamine, MK-801), a corticotropin-releasing factor 1 receptor antagonist (R121919), a β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (butoxamine), an α2-adrenergic receptor agonist (lofexidine), and a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist (ondansetron) had no effect on OWIH. These data demonstrate that the stable cold plate at 2~°C yields a robust, reliable, and concise measure of OWIH that is sensitive to opioid agonists.},

  abstract = {Alcoholism is a major public health problem and resembles, in many ways, other chronic relapsing medical conditions. At least 2 separate dimensions of its symptomatology offer targetable pathophysiological mechanisms. Systems that mediate positive reinforcement by alcohol are likely important targets in early stages of the disease, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. In contrast, long term neuroadaptive changes caused by chronic alcohol use primarily appear to affect systems mediating negative affective states, and gain importance following a prolonged history of dependence. Feasibility of pharmacological treatment in alcoholism has been demonstrated by a first wave of drugs which consists of 3 currently approved medications, the aldehyde dehydrogenase blocker disulfiram, the opioid antagonist naltrexone (NTX) and the functional glutamate antagonist acamprosate (ACM). The treatment toolkit is likely to be expanded in the near future. This will improve overall efficacy and allow individualized treatment, ultimately taking in account the patient's genetic makeup. In a second wave, early human efficacy data are available for the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron, the GABA-B agonist baclofen and the anticonvulsant topiramate. The third wave is comprised of compounds predicted to be effective based on a battery of animal models. Using such models, a short list of additional targets has accumulated sufficient preclinical validation to merit clinical development. These include the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, receptors modulating glutamatergic transmission (mGluR2, 3 and 5), and receptors for stress-related neuropeptides corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nociceptin. Once novel treatments are developed, the field faces a major challenge to assure their delivery to patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of patient subgroups to enhance treatment effects is an important topic in personalized (or tailored) alcohol treatment. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify subgroups benefiting from treatment. These novel data mining methods help to address the limitations of traditional regression-based methods that focus on interactions. METHODS: We propose an exploratory approach, using recursive partitioning methods, for example, interaction trees (IT) and virtual twins (VT), to flexibly identify subgroups in which the treatment effect is likely to be large. We apply these tree-based methods to a pharmacogenetic trial of ondansetron. RESULTS: Our methods identified several subgroups based on patients' genetic and other prognostic covariates. Among the 251 subjects with complete genotype information, the IT method identified 118 with specific genetic and other prognostic factors, resulting in a 17.2\% decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days (PHDD). The VT method identified 88 subjects with a 21.8\% decrease in PHDD. Overall, the VT subgroup achieved a good balance between the treatment effect and the group size. CONCLUSIONS: A data mining approach is proposed as a valid exploratory method to identify a sufficiently large subgroup of subjects that is likely to receive benefit from treatment in an alcohol dependence pharmacotherapy trial. Our results provide new insights into the heterogeneous nature of alcohol dependence and could help clinicians to tailor treatment to the biological profile of individual patients, thereby achieving better treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {The effect of the i.p. administration of ethanol on the release of dopamine (DA) and on the output of its main metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, was estimated in the rat by transcerebral dialysis of two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal caudate. Low doses of ethanol (0.25-0.5 g/kg i.p.) stimulated DA release specifically in the n. accumbens and elicited pure behavioral stimulation. Higher doses of ethanol (1.0-2.5 g/kg) elicited sedation and hypnosis and stimulated further DA release and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid output in the accumbens and, although less, also in the caudate. High doses of ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) elicited long-lasting hypnosis and sedation and induced a depression followed by stimulation of DA release in the accumbens. DA release in the caudate was stimulated further. Low doses of apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) reversed completely the stimulant effect of 0.5 g/kg of ethanol on behavior and on DA release in the accumbens. Moreover, the stimulation of behavior and of DA release in the accumbens elicited by 0.5 g/kg of ethanol were abolished completely by pretreatment with 700 mg/kg of gamma-butyrolactone, an agent which blocks DA firing and DA release. The results indicate that ethanol preferentially stimulates DA transmission in the mesolimbic system probably by activating the firing activity of mesolimbic DA neurons and provide direct evidence that these changes are involved in the motor stimulant effects of ethanol.},

  abstract = {Subtyping alcoholics may provide a more accurate guide as to the course and character of the disease. Classifications of different ages of onset of problem drinking have so far resulted in categorical inconsistencies. In the past, hospital-based alcoholics have over-represented those most severely ill, and comprehensive evaluations of psychopathology for discriminating between alcoholic subtypes have been infrequent. In a heterogeneous treatment-seeking, outpatient, alcoholic population, we tested the hypothesis that age of onset represents a continuum of disease, and that greater severity of psychopathology is associated with lower ages of onset. Using a standard questionnaire, 253 male and female treatment-seeking alcoholics were stratified according to specific ages of onset: a) {$<$} 20 years; b) 20-25 years, and c) {$>$} 25 years. These age of onset groups were compared on alcohol severity and craving, family history, childhood behavior, personality, hostility, overt aggression, mood, and social functioning. Symptom severity and age of onset were negatively correlated, and the 20-25-year onset group usually had intermediate scores. The {$<$} 20 year onset group was characterized by greater severity of alcohol-related problems, family history, childhood behavioral problems, craving, hostility, antisocial traits, mood disturbance, and poor social functioning. Alcoholics with an earlier age of onset have relatively greater psychopathology than those of later onset. While the preponderance of psychopathology among those in the {$<$} 20-year onset group could be conceptualized as a clinical "subtype," such a characterization would not define an entirely homogeneous category. Yet, this clinical characterization would be clinically important if specific age of onset levels were found to be differentially sensitive to pharmacological and/or psychological treatments.},

  abstract = {Background: Individuals considered to be early onset alcoholics (EOA) are characterized by an early onset age, a broad range of antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and presumed biological disease predisposition. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, improves drinking outcomes and increases abstinence rates among EOA. Individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of ␤-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in ␤-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. The propensity for naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) to reduce alcohol’s rewarding effects and drinking in humans is greatest in individuals with high familial loading. Predicated on the added knowledge that 5-HT3 receptors may themselves mediate alcohol reward via activation of the endogenous opioid system, we hypothesized that the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone would act synergistically and would be an effective treatment in EOA. Methods: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial in which 20 EOA were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) ϩ naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) or placebo as an adjunct to weekly standardized group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Results: At endpoint, subjects who received ondansetron ϩ naltrexone (n ϭ 10), compared with those who received placebo (n ϭ 10), had fewer drinks/day (covariate adjusted mean 0.99 Ϯ 0.60 vs. 3.68 Ϯ 0.63; F1, 16 ϭ 9.35, p ϭ 0.008; effect size ϭ 1.42), drinks/drinking day (covariate adjusted mean 3.14 Ϯ 0.87 vs. 6.76 Ϯ 0.71; F1, 13 ϭ 10.45, p ϭ 0.007; effect size ϭ 1.71), and a trend toward increased percent days abstinent (covariate adjusted mean 69.76 Ϯ 8.64 vs. 48.24 Ϯ 9.12; F1, 16 ϭ 3.58, p ϭ 0.08; effect size ϭ 0.88). Conclusions: Ondansetron plus naltrexone seems to synergistically improve the drinking outcomes of EOA.

  abstract = {Preclinical studies have exploded our knowledge about the behavioral and biological underpinnings of alcoholism. These studies suggest that certain neurotransmitters, particularly those interacting with the opioid, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and monoamine systems, may play a critical role in the expression of alcohol-drinking and other behaviors associated with its abuse liability. Built upon this foundation, important advances have been made in the development of therapeutic medications for the treatment of alcoholism. Of the medications reviewed, acamprosate's potential appears to be the most widely established. In the USA, naltrexone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1995 for the treatment of alcoholism; however, the results of some studies have been less encouraging. Naltrexone's reliance on high compliance rates for efficacy may, eventually, limit its potential in clinical settings offering generic treatment for alcoholism. The relative paucity of dose-response studies on naltrexone's effects in treating alcoholics is an important gap in the literature. Recent data from a large clinical trial suggests that ondansetron, a serotonin3 antagonist, offers new hope for the treatment of early onset alcoholics; a type of alcoholism most difficult to manage with psychosocial measures alone. Different subtypes of alcoholic may, therefore, have varying treatment responses to serotonergic agents. Matching subtypes of alcoholic to effective treatment medications based upon their different biologies remains an important therapeutic goal. Combinations of effective pharmacological agents need exploration as they may prove to be synergistic, and could shepherd in a new era of treatments aimed at multiple neurotransmitter targets associated with the alcoholism disease. The coming decade promises more powerful tools for characterizing drug effects on alcohol drinking, thereby closing the gap between animal models of addiction and the human condition.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Early-onset alcoholism differs from late-onset alcoholism by its association with greater serotonergic abnormality and antisocial behaviors. Thus, individuals with early-onset alcoholism may be responsive to treatment with a selective serotonergic agent. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that drinking outcomes associated with early vs late-onset alcoholism are differentially improved by the selective 5-HT(3) (serotonin) antagonist ondansetron. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTINGS: University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston (April 1995-June 1998) and University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (July 1998-December 1999). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 321 patients with diagnosed alcoholism (mean age, 40.6 years; 70.5\% male; 78.6\% white) were enrolled, 271 of whom proceeded to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: After 1 lead-in week of single-blind placebo, patients were randomly assigned to receive 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron, 1 microg/kg (n = 67), 4 microg/kg (n = 77), or 16 microg/kg (n = 71) twice per day; or identical placebo (n = 56). All patients also participated in weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported alcohol consumption (drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent, and total days abstinent per study week); and plasma carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) level, an objective and sensitive marker of transient alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Patients with early-onset alcoholism who received ondansetron (1, 4, and 16 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who were administered placebo, had fewer drinks per day (1.89, 1.56, and 1.87 vs 3.30; P =.03, P =.01, and P =.02, respectively) and drinks per drinking day (4.75, 4.28, and 5.18 vs 6.90; P =.03, P =.004, and P =.03, respectively). Ondansetron, 4 microg/kg twice per day, was superior to placebo in increasing percentage of days abstinent (70.10 vs 50.20; P =.02) and total days abstinent per study week (6.74 vs 5.92; P =.03). Among patients with early-onset alcoholism, there was a significant difference in the mean log CDT ratio between those who received ondansetron (1 and 4 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who received the placebo (-0.17 and -0.19 vs 0.12; P =.03 and P =.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ondansetron (particularly the 4 microg/kg twice per day dosage) is an effective treatment for patients with early-onset alcoholism, presumably by ameliorating an underlying serotonergic abnormality.

  abstract = {Rationale: Early onset alcoholics (EOA) differ from late onset alcoholics (LOA) by having greater serotonergic abnormality, familial history, and a range of antisocial behaviors. Previously, we showed that ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, effectively treated EOA. Proximate motivational drives such as craving could have determined drinking behavior. We therefore investigated whether ondansetron treatment would reduce alcohol craving significantly among EOA. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that the craving outcomes of EOA, compared with LOA, would be differentially improved by ondansetron. We also tested the prediction that craving would be significantly correlated with drinking behavior. Methods: We studied a cohort of 253 out of 321 enrolled alcohol dependent subjects. These 253 subjects were entered into a 1-week lead-in single-blind placebo period followed by 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment. Study design was a 2 (EOA versus LOA)×4 medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 µg/kg b.i.d)×13 (visits) factorial analysis of variance. Craving was measured at each visit using seven visual analogue scales. Subjects received 12 weekly sessions of standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Results: Data reduction by factor analysis of the visual analog scale items yielded one dimension, overall craving. Ondansetron 4 µg/kg b.i.d. reduced overall craving significantly among EOA. In contrast, ondansetron (1 µg/kg b.i.d.) increased craving significantly in LOA. Decreased overall craving was positively correlated with reduced drinking and negatively associated with increased abstinence. Conclusions: Compared with placebo, ondansetron (4 µg/kg b.i.d.) was associated with significant reductions in overall craving in EOA but not LOA, presumably by ameliorating serotonergic abnormality.},

  abstract = {Background:               Early‐onset alcoholics (EOA) differ from late‐onset alcoholics (LOA) by developing problem drinking during youth, experiencing severe behavioral problems, having a familial disease history, and possessing a tendency toward subsyndromal mood disturbance, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Subsyndromal mood disturbance is, therefore, an important component of the early‐onset syndrome and may be mediated by serotonin dysfunction. Therefore, the serotonin‐3 antagonist ondansetron, which has been shown to be effective at improving drinking outcomes and promoting abstinence among EOA, presumably by ameliorating serotonin dysfunction, also may exert its beneficial effects by alleviating mood disturbance among EOA.                                         Methods:               After one lead‐in week of single‐blind placebo administration, subjects underwent 11 weeks of double‐blind outpatient treatment using a 2 × 4 factorial design that examined age of onset (EOA versus LOA) and medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 μg/kg twice daily) combined with weekly standardized group cognitive‐behavioral therapy. The placebo lead‐in week was used to adjust for study entrance effects but not for excluding subjects. Assessments of mood were performed by using the overall score and subscales of the Profile of Mood States both at screening and at weekly intervals during the study.                                         Results:               Subsyndromal mood disturbance was shown to be an important component of early‐onset alcoholism. Ondansetron (16 μg/kg twice daily) showed greater therapeutic efficacy at alleviating symptoms of overall mood disturbance, fatigue, vigor, confusion/bewilderment, and depression among EOA compared with LOA. EOA‐associated improvements in mood disturbance seemed to be independent of drinking behavior.                                         Conclusions:               Ondansetron has been shown to be an effective treatment for early‐onset alcoholism. Ondansetron's ability to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility among EOA may make an additional contribution to its therapeutic effect. Mechanistic studies are needed to delineate more clearly the relationship between serotonin dysfunction and pathophysiology among various subtypes of alcohol‐dependent individuals.},

  abstract = {Preclinical studies have contributed greatly to our understanding of the neurochemical pathways associated with the development and maintenance of alcohol-seeking behaviour. These studies have demonstrated the important role of serotonin pathways, particularly as they relate to dopaminergic function, which mediates alcohol-induced reward associated with its abuse liability. Naturally, this has led to the study of serotonergic agents as treatments for alcoholism.SSRIs do not appear to be effective treatment for a heterogeneous alcoholic group. However, they may be useful as treatment for late-onset alcoholics, or alcoholism complicated by comorbid major depression. Buspirone, a serotonin 5-HT1A partial agonist, does not appear to be an effective treatment for alcoholics without comorbid disease. Buspirone may, however, have some utility for treating alcoholics with comorbid anxiety disorder. The 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin, at pharmacologically relevant clinical doses, does not appear to be an effective treatment for alcoholism. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, is an efficacious and promising medication for the treatment of early-onset alcoholism. Preliminary evidence suggests that combining the mu antagonist naltrexone with the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron promises to be more effective for treating alcoholism than either alone. The differential treatment effect of SSRIs and ondansetron among various subtypes of alcoholic is intriguing. Future research is needed to understand more clearly the molecular genetic differences and the interactions of such differences with the environment that typify a particular alcoholic subtype. Such an understanding could enable us to make comfortable predictions as to which alcoholic subtype might respond best to a particular serotonergic agent, which could then be provided.},

  abstract = {Prior studies have demonstrated inefficacy among dopamine receptor antagonists for treating cocaine dependence. An alternative approach would be to investigate the ability of indirect inhibitors of cortico-mesolimbic dopamine release, such as the 5-HT₃ receptor antagonist ondansetron, to reduce cocaine's reinforcing effects. We hypothesized that ondansetron might be more efficacious than placebo at reducing cocaine intake and promoting abstinence in cocaine-dependent individuals. In a pilot randomized, double-blind, 10-week controlled trial, 63 treatment-seeking, cocaine-dependent men and women received ondansetron (0.25 mg, 1.0 mg, or 4.0 mg twice daily) or placebo. Up to three times per week, participants were assessed on several measures of cocaine use, including urine benzoylecgonine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was administered weekly. Ondansetron was well tolerated, causing no serious adverse events. The ondansetron 4.0 mg group had the lowest dropout rate among all treatment groups and a greater rate of improvement in percentage of participants with a cocaine-free week compared with the placebo group (p=0.02), whereas the ondansetron 1.0 mg group had a lower rate of improvement in percentage of weekly mean non-use days than did placebo recipients (p=0.04). These results suggest the possibility of a non-linear dose-response function, with evidence supporting efficacy for the 4.0 mg group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The past decade has seen an expansion of research and knowledge on pharmacotherapy for the treatment of alcohol dependence. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications naltrexone and acamprosate have shown mixed results in clinical trials. Oral naltrexone and naltrexone depot formulations have generally demonstrated efficacy at treating alcohol dependence, but their treatment effect size is small, and more research is needed to compare the effects of different doses on drinking outcome. Acamprosate has demonstrated efficacy for treating alcohol dependence in European trials, but with a small effect size. In U.S. trials, acamprosate has not proved to be efficacious. Research continues to explore which types of alcohol-dependent individual would benefit the most from treatment with naltrexone or acamprosate. The combination of the two medications demonstrated efficacy for treating alcohol dependence in one European study but not in a multi-site U.S. study. Another FDA-approved medication, disulfiram, is an aversive agent that does not diminish craving for alcohol. Disulfiram is most effective when given to those who are highly compliant or who are receiving their medication under supervision. Of the non-approved medications, topiramate is among the most promising, with a medium effect size in clinical trials. Another promising medication, baclofen, has shown efficacy in small trials. Serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, appear to be efficacious only among certain genetic subtypes of alcoholic. As neuroscientific research progresses, other promising medications, as well as medication combinations, for treating alcohol dependence continue to be explored.},

  abstract = {Alcoholism remains a serious cause of morbidity and mortality despite progress through neurobiological research in identifying new pharmacological strategies for its treatment. Drugs that affect neural pathways that modulate the activity of the cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system have been shown to alter drinking behavior, presumably because this dopaminergic system is closely associated with rewarding behavior. Ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen are examples. Subtyping alcoholism in adults into an early-onset type, with chronic symptoms and a strong biological predisposition to the disease, and a late-onset type, typically brought on by psychosocial triggers and associated with mood symptoms, may help in the selection of optimal therapy. Emerging adults with binge drinking patterns also might be aided by selective treatments. Although preliminary work on the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism and its treatment has been promising, the assignment to treatment still depends on clinical assessment. Brief behavioral interventions that encourage the patient to set goals for a reduction in heavy drinking or abstinence also are part of optimal therapy.},

  abstract = {Reports an error in 'Pharmacogenetic approach at the serotonin transporter gene as a method of reducing the severity of alcohol drinking' by Bankole A. Johnson, Nassima Ait-Daoud, Chamindi Seneviratne, John D. Roache, Martin A. Javors, Xin-Qun Wang, Lei Liu, J. Kim Penberthy, Carlo C. DiClemente and Ming D. Li (The American Journal of Psychiatry, 2011[Mar], Vol 168[3], 265-275). Table 2 in the original article contained errors in the clinical data. With respect to baseline self reported percentage of days abstinent, the numbers should have read as follows (from left to right): 18.0, 22.5, 15.0, 18.2, 22.3, 22.6, 13.7, 18.1, 11.2, 12.3, 19.8, 22.3, 13.6, 13.7, 18.1, and 22.1. Also, the mean (SD) revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale score values in the placebo TT column were transposed with the mean (SD) values in the placebo TG/GG column. The mean (SD) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score values in the ondansetron TT column were transposed with the mean (SD) values in the ondansetron TG/GG column. The mean value for age at alcoholism onset in the ondansetron TT column should have read 28.8 instead of 38.8. Finally, the mean values for social class in the placebo TT column should have read 21, 20, and 2 for social classes 1–3, 4–6, and 7–9, respectively, instead of 41, 36, and 4. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-10652-010[/rid]). Objective: Severe drinking can cause serious morbidity and death. Because the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-HT function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-HT₃ receptor antagonist, ondansetron. Method: The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5′-regulatory region of the 5-HTT gene (LL/LS/SS), with additional genotyping for another functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 3′-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants received either ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy. Results: Individuals with the LL genotype who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27\% ) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73\% ) in LL compared with LS/SS individuals. LL individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (9.65\% ) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5′-HTTLPR and rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. LL/TT individuals in the ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (–2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99\% ) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. Conclusions: The authors propose a new pharmacogenetic approach using ondansetron to treat severe drinking and improve abstinence in alcoholics.

  abstract = {This chapter discusses pharmacological approaches to the treatment of alcohol dependence in the young. Alcohol dependence is a treatable disorder when efficacious medicines are added to enhance the effects of psychosocial treatment. The past decade has seen an expansion of research and knowledge on pharmacotherapy for the treatment of alcohol dependence; however, no pharmacotherapeutic agent has been established as a treatment for alcohol-abusing or -dependent adolescents or emerging adults. Thus, most of what is known has been extrapolated from the adult literature. The newer approved medications for adults include acamprosate as well as naltrexone and its intramuscular analog, Vivitrol. Among the other promising agents, topiramate, ondansetron, and baclofen appear to be the most noteworthy. Additionally, there is published preliminary work showing some utility for acamprosate, disulfiram, ondansetron, and rialtrexone in treating alcohol-abusing or -dependent adolescents. Presently, research is pursuing the application of ondansetron or naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol-abusing or -dependent emerging adults. The current state of the art is to find medications that enhance the efficacy of brief psychosocial treatments, which are the standard treatment for alcohol-abusing or -dependent adolescents and emerging adults. An important clinical aspect of treating alcohol-abusing or -dependent adolescents or emerging adults is that a goal of lifelong abstinence might not be adopted by most, thus emphasizing the need for a harm reduction approach as well as appropriate safeguards and procedures for lifetime monitoring. As neuroscientific research progresses, it is plausible that unique medication combinations will be tested as treatment agents for alcohol abuse or dependence in adolescents and emerging adults. Intriguingly, pharmacogenetic approaches could be particularly useful because they might provide an approach for early intervention in treating alcohol abuse or dependence, particularly among those who may have a high genetic predisposition to the disease.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors previously reported that the 5'-HTTLPR-LL and rs1042173-TT (SLC6A4-LL/TT) genotypes in the serotonin transporter gene predicted a significant reduction in the severity of alcohol consumption among alcoholics receiving the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron. In this study, they explored additional markers of ondansetron treatment response in alcoholics by examining polymorphisms in the HTR3A and HTR3B genes, which regulate directly the function and binding of 5-HT3 receptors to ondansetron. METHOD: The authors genotyped one rare and 18 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HTR3A and HTR3B in the same sample that they genotyped for SLC6A4-LL/TT in the previous randomized, double-blind, 11-week clinical trial. Participants were 283 European Americans who received oral ondansetron (4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) or placebo along with weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Associations of individual and combined genotypes with treatment response on drinking outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals carrying one or more of genotypes rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG in HTR3A and rs17614942-AC in HTR3B showed a significant overall mean difference between ondansetron and placebo in drinks per drinking day (22.50; effect size=0.867), percentage of heavy drinking days (220.58\%; effect size=0.780), and percentage of days abstinent (18.18\%; effect size=0.683). Combining these HTR3A/HTR3B and SLC6A4-LL/TT genotypes increased the target cohort from approaching 20\% (identified in the previous study) to 34\%. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present initial evidence suggesting that a combined fivemarker genotype panel can be used to predict the outcome of treatment of alcohol dependence with ondansetron. Additional, larger pharmacogenetic studies would help to validate these results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and over 95 million people live with alcohol dependence globally. The estimated heritability of AUD is 50-60 \%, and multiple genes are thought to contribute to various endophenotypes of the disease. Previous clinical trials support a precision medicine approach using ondansetron (AD04, a 5-HT3 antagonist) by segregating AUD populations by the bio-genetic endophenotype of specific serotonergic genotypes and the bio-psychosocial endophenotype of the severity of drinking or both. By targeting the modulation of biogenetic signaling within the biopsychosocial context of AUD, low-dose AD04 holds promise in reducing alcohol consumption among affected individuals while minimizing adverse effects. METHODS: This was a phase III, 6-month, 25-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial using AD04 to treat DSM-V-categorized AUD individuals who were pre-stratified into the endophenotypes of heavy or very heavy drinking individuals and possessed a pre-defined profile of genetic variants related to the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor. Participants (N = 303) presented moderate to severe AUD, {$>$}80 \% were men, mostly in their fifties, and {$>$}95 \% were of European descent. Low-dose AD04 (approx. 033 mg twice daily) or a matching placebo was administered twice daily for 6 months. Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET [53]) was administered every two weeks to enhance medication compliance and clinic attendance. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the monthly percentage of heavy drinking days, PHDD (-46·7 \% (2·7 \%), 95 \%CI: -52·1 \% to -41·2 \% vs. -38·1 \% (2·9 \%), 95 \%CI: -43·8 \% to -32·5 \%, respectively; LS mean difference=-8·5 \%; p = 0.03) among AD04-treated vs. placebo-receiving heavy drinking individuals at month 6. Heavy drinking individuals were also less likely to be diagnosed with AUD [Month 1: -32·0 \% (2·8 \%), 95 \%CI: -37·5 \% to -26·5 \% vs. -23·2 \% (2·9 \%), 95 \%CI: -28·9 to -17·5 \%; LS mean difference= -8·8 \%; p = 0·026)], and improved on the WHO quality of life BREF scale with a significant effect for at least a 1-level downward shift (OR = 3.4; 95 \% CI: 1·03-11·45, p = 0·044). Importantly, heavy drinking individuals, as distinct from very heavy drinking individuals, were the bio-psychosocial endophenotype more predictive of therapeutic response to AD04. AD04 had an exceptional safety and tolerability profile, like the placebo's. CONCLUSIONS: In this Phase 3 clinical trial, AD04 was shown to be a promising treatment for currently drinking heavy drinking individuals with AUD who also possess a specific genotypic profile in the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor complex. Using AD04 to reduce the harm of AUD in heavy drinking individuals who are currently drinking, without the necessity of abstinence or detoxification from alcohol use, is an important advance in the field of precision medicine. AD04's adverse events profile, which was like placebo, should enhance accessibility and acceptance of modern medical treatment for AUD by lowering the incorrect but commonly perceived stigma of personal failure.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The neurobiological basis of alcohol dependence, established pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence, pharmacotherapies under investigation, and obstacles to treatment are discussed. SUMMARY: Alcohol binds to hydrophobic pockets of proteins, changing their three-dimensional structure and their function. Proteins that are particularly sensitive to alcohol include ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and enzymes involved in signal transduction. Established pharmacologic treatments, notably disulfiram and naltrexone, combined with behavioral therapies, may reduce the amount of drinking, the risk of relapse, the number of days of drinking, and craving in some alcohol-dependent individuals. For many patients, however, these treatments are not effective. Recent advances in molecular and behavior genetics are guiding the development of new drugs; these efforts seek to identify pharmacologic pathways relevant to alcohol dependence and to more effectively match treatments to individuals according to their genetic characteristics. Efficacy and safety concerns for acamprosate have been satisfied; the drug was recently released for marketing in the United States. Medications such as sertraline, ondansetron, topiramate, and aripiprazole represent novel lines of research and are currently being tested for use in the treatment of alcoholism. Even with more efficacious medications, however, a transformation must occur in how alcoholism treatment is viewed, not only by the public but also by clinicians. CONCLUSION: In addition to existing drug treatments for alcohol dependence, many other medications are under investigation, particularly for specific types of alcoholism. Pharmacogenomics is expected to play an important role in this research effort.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Serotonergic mechanisms are associated with the development of alcohol dependence (AD), however, studies evaluating serotonergic medications have produced conflicting results. One hypothesis suggests that differential response may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5-HTTLPR promoter region of the serotonin re-uptake transporter (5-HTT). The L/L genotype is postulated to be associated with early onset alcoholism and the S/S or S/L genotypes associated with late onset alcoholism. The aim of this study was to match and mismatch L/L, S/S, or S/L genotypes with administration of ondansetron and sertraline. METHODS: Fifteen nontreatment seeking alcohol-dependent individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive either 200 mg/d of sertraline or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE), then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE. Participants then received the alternate drug for 2 weeks followed by a third ASAE. RESULTS: At the first ASAE compared to sertraline, ondansetron significantly improved drinking outcomes for the L/L genotype for the ASAE volume consumed (100\% reduction based on between-subjects comparison, t = 2.35), and for drinks per drinking day during the 7 days prior to the ASAE (79\% reduction and t = 4.34). Compared with ondansetron for S/S or S/L genotypes, outcomes at ASAE 1 for sertraline and S/S or S/L genotypes are opposite than hypothesized. Overall, subjects reduced drinking across their participation in the trial, as there appears to be an order effect. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that ondansetron may reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent individuals who have the L/L genotype as measured naturalistically and during the ASAE. By contrast there was no support that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have S/S or S/L genotypes. Evidence in the literature suggests that AD in some individuals may be influenced by a gene by socio-environmental interaction making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. Research must consider that typologies may predict successful treatment of AD in future trials.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that alcoholics show comparatively lower levels of serotonin (5-HT) than non-alcoholics. Medications aimed at increasing synaptic 5-HT have long been studied as potential treatments for alcoholism. Studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in a heterogeneous population of non-depressed alcoholics have produced inconsistent results. Further exploration involved whether or not treatment of co-morbid alcoholism and depression was a more practical approach. However, even in the presence of co-occurring depression, antidepressants in general lack the power to demonstrate a significant reduction of alcohol use among alcohol dependent patients with carefully diagnosed major depression. Further statistical analysis has also determined that perhaps genotypic and phenotypic variations differ for persons with alcohol dependence including those with or without comorbid alcohol dependence and depression suggesting important subgroups might respond differently to treatments. Clinical trials have also used the anxiolytic buspirone, a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist, as many alcoholics suffer from anxiety. When controlling for baseline anxiety, buspirone was no more effective than placebo for alcoholic patients. Another serotonergic drug, ritanserin, did not demonstrate effectiveness in relapse prevention in alcohol dependence. However, research on the use of the 5-HT(3) antagonist ondansetron for alcohol dependence continues to provide promising results, particularly for patients with early onset alcoholism. As demonstrated by the studies with serotonergics, responses based on individual variables suggest that alcoholics may respond differentially based on various serotonin 5-HT subtypes. Of course, future studies need to further delineate and confirm the differences between these alcoholic subtypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One hypothesis suggests that the differential response to ondansetron- and serotonin-specific re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5'-HTTLPR promoter region in SLC6A4, the gene that codes for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). The LL 5'-HTTLPR genotype is postulated to be specifically sensitive to the effects of ondansetron with SS/SL 5'-HTTLPR genotypes sensitive to SSRIs. This study tests this hypothesis by matching nontreatment-seeking alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals with LL genotype to ondansetron and SS/SL genotypes to the SSRI sertraline, and mismatching them assessing naturalistic and bar-laboratory alcohol drinking. METHODS: Seventy-seven AD individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive sertraline 200 mg/d or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE) and then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE. Individuals then received the alternate drug for 3 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Drinks per drinking day (DDD with drinks in standard drinking units) for 7 days prior to each ASAE and milliliters consumed during each ASAE were the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five participants completed the study. The genotype × order interaction was significant, F(1, 47) = 8.42, p = 0.006, for DDD. Three analyses of covariance were conducted for DDD during the week before each ASAE. Ondansetron compared to sertraline resulted in a significant reduction in DDD during the week before the first, F(1, 47) = 7.64, p = 0.008, but not the third ASAE. There was no difference in milliliters consumed during each ASAE. CONCLUSIONS: This study modestly supports the hypothesis that ondansetron may reduce DDD in AD individuals with the LL genotype as measured naturalistically. By contrast, there was no support that ondansetron reduces drinking during the ASAEs or that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have SS/SL genotypes. We provide limited support that ondansetron may reduce drinking in nontreatment-seeking individuals with the LL genotype.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the interaction of 5-HTTLPR and DRD4 exon III polymorphisms with gender in non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals while alternately taking ondansetron and sertraline. Evidence suggests that alcohol dependence may be influenced by a genetic interaction that may be gender-specific with temporal changes making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. The main trial was a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled human laboratory study with 77 non-treatment-seeking AD individuals randomized (55 completed, 49 complete data) to receive 200 mg/day of sertraline or 0.5 mg/day of ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE), then placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE, then receive the alternate drug, in a counterbalanced order, for 3 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Results for men were not significant. Women with the LL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving ondansetron and SS/SL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving sertraline (matched), drank significantly fewer drinks per drinking day (DDD) during the 7 days prior to the first and third ASAEs than women receiving the mismatched medication (i.e., sertraline to LL and ondansetron to SS/SL). In a 3way interaction, 5-HTTLPR alleles by DRD4 alleles by medications, women with the LL genotype who received ondansetron and had DRD4 !7 exon III repeats drank significantly fewer DDD as did SS/SL women who received sertraline but conversely had DRD4 {$<$}7 repeats in the 7-day period leading up to the first and third ASAEs. Consistent with these data was a significant reduction of milliliters consumed ad libitum during these same ASAEs. These exploratory findings add possible support to gender and genetic differences among AD individuals in response to serotonergic pharmacotherapies. Future trials should be powerful enough to take into account that endophenotypes and a targeting of serotonergic interactions may be essential to successfully treat alcohol dependence.},

High-dose, long-acting benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, and 2 anti-seizure agents, carbamazepine and valproate, are being used for alcohol withdrawal. For maintenance treatment, opioid antagonists and various serotonergic agents, such as fluoxetine and ondansetron, show promise. For opioid dependence, clonidine-naltrexone detoxification appears quite cost-effective, and buprenorphine and levo-alpha-acetylmethadol show promise for both detoxification and maintenance.

  abstract = {In this paper we view alcohol dependence and the response to treatment as a recurrent bio-behavioral process developing in time and propose formal models of this process combining behavior and biology in silico. The behavioral components of alcohol dependence and treatment are formally described by a stochastic process of human behavior, which serves as an event generator challenging the metabolic system. The biological component is driven by the biochemistry of alcohol intoxication described by deterministic models of ethanol pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics to enable simulation of drinking addiction in humans. Derived from the known physiology of ethanol and the literature of both ethanol intoxication and ethanol absorption, the different models are distilled into a minimal model (as simple as the complexity of the data allows) that can represent any specific patient. We use these modeling and simulation techniques to explain responses to placebo and ondansetron treatment observed in clinical studies. Specifically, the response to placebo was explained by a reduction of the probability of environmental reinforcement, while the effect of ondansetron was explained by a gradual decline in the degree of ethanol-induced neuromodulation. Further, we use in silico experiments to study critical transitions in blood alcohol levels after specific average number of drinks per day, and propose the existence of two critical thresholds in the human—one at 5 and another at 11 drinks/day—at which the system shifts from stable to critical and to super critical state indicating a state of alcohol addiction. The advantages of such a model-based investigation are that (1) the process of instigation of alcohol dependence and its treatment can be deconstructed into meaningful steps, which allow for individualized treatment tailoring, and (2) physiology and behavior can be quantified in different (animal or human) studies and then the results can be integrated insilico.

  abstract = {Background: Early-onset alcoholics (EOAs) have a greater familial loading for alcoholism, more severe progression of the disorder, a greater severity of comorbid psychopathology, and a poorer response to treatment than late-onset alcoholics (LOAs). Ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist, was found to be superior to placebo in the treatment of EOAs, but not of LOAs. This study compared the tolerability and potential efficacy of an oral solution of ondansetron in EOAs versus LOAs. Methods: Forty outpatients with alcohol dependence (67.5\% male; 87.5\% European American; 20 EOAs; 20 LOAs) received an oral solution of ondansetron at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily for 8 weeks, together with weekly relapse-prevention therapy. Results: EOAs had a significantly greater decrease in drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and alcohol-related problems than LOAs. Changes in the level of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were consistent with changes in self-reported drinking behavior. Conclusions: An oral solution of ondansetron seems suitable for the treatment of alcohol dependence, yielding findings consistent with evidence from a placebo-controlled trial that ondansetron, at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily, is of value in the treatment of EOAs.},

To compare the relative bioavailability of an extemporaneous ondansetron capsule formulation with that of an identical dose of the commercially available solution formulation. Design.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 4-mg dose of either the commercially available ondansetron solution or the extemporaneous ondansetron capsule formulation. Blood sampling was performed over 12 hours after dosing. After a washout period of at least 3 days, each participant was switched to the alternate formulation, and blood sampling was repeated. Measurements and Main Results. Ondansetron was well absorbed after administration of both formulations, with the solution achieving a faster rate of drug absorption over the first hour of dosing. After the peak plasma concentration was achieved, the plasma concentration–time curves of both formulations declined at a similar steady rate. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two formulations, and the relative bioavailability of the capsule versus the solution formulation was 101\%. Conclusions. Similar concentration-time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters were achieved with the two formulations. The commercially available solution would be a useful alternative formulation for administration of low-dose ondansetron in research and clinical settings.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We previously found that systemic injections of the 5-HT uptake blocker fluoxetine attenuate intermittent footshock stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in rats, while inhibition of 5-HT neurons in the median raphe induces reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In this study, we further explored the role of 5-HT in footshock stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking by determining the effects of the 5-HT releaser and reuptake blocker dexfenfluramine, and the 5-HT receptor antagonists ondansetron and tropisetron, which decrease alcohol self-administration and anxiety-like responses in rats, on this reinstatement. METHODS: Different groups of male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer alcohol (12\% v/v) for 28-31 days (1 h/day, 0.19 ml per alcohol delivery) and then their lever responding for alcohol was extinguished over 9-10 days. Subsequently, the effect of systemic injections of vehicle or dexfenfluramine (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg, i.p), ondansetron (0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p), or tropisetron (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p) on reinstatement induced by 10 min of intermittent footshock (0.8 mA) was determined. RESULTS: Systemic injections of dexfenfluramine, ondansetron or tropisetron attenuated footshock-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Injections of dexfenfluramine, ondansetron, or tropisetron had no effect on extinguished lever responding in the absence of footshock. CONCLUSIONS: The present results provide additional support for the hypothesis that brain 5-HT systems are involved in stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. The neuronal mechanisms that potentially mediate the unexpected observation that both stimulation of 5-HT release and blockade of 5-HT3 receptors attenuate footshock-induced reinstatement are discussed.},

  abstract = {Psychostimulant abuse continues to present legal, socioeconomic and medical challenges as a primary psychiatric disorder, and represents a significant comorbid factor in major psychiatric and medical illnesses. To date, monotherapeutic drug treatments have not proven effective in promoting long-term abstinence in psychostimulant abusers. In contrast to clinical trials utilizing monotherapies, combinations of dopamine (DA) agonists and selective 5-HT₃, 5HT2A/2C, or NK₁ antagonists have shown robust efficacy in reversing behavioral and neurobiological alterations in animal models of psychostimulant abuse. One important temporal requirement for these treatments is that the 5-HT or NK₁ receptor antagonist be given at a critical time window after DA agonist administration. This requirement may reflect a necessary dosing regimen towards normalizing underlying dysfunctional neural circuits and 'addiction memory' states. Indeed, chronic psychostimulant abuse can be conceptualized as a consolidated form of dysfunctional memory maintained by repeated drug- or cue-induced reactivation of neural circuit and subsequent reconsolidation. According to this concept, the DA agonist given first may reactivate this memory circuit, thereby rendering it transiently labile. The subsequent antagonist is hypothesized to disrupt reconsolidation necessary for restabilization, thus leading progressively to a therapeutically-mediated abolishment of dysfunctional synaptic plasticity. We propose that long-term abstinence in psychostimulant abusers may be achieved not only by targeting putative mechanistic pathways, but also by optimizing drug treatment regimens designed to disrupt the neural processes underlying the addicted state.

  abstract = {A large body of literature has emerged concerning the role of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) in the regulation of alcohol intake and the development of alcoholism. Despite the wealth of information, the functional significance of this neurotransmitter remains to be fully elucidated. This paper, part one of a two-part review, summarizes the available clinical research along two lines: the effects of alcohol on serotonergic functioning and the effects of pharmacological manipulation of serotonergic functioning on alcohol intake in normal (nonalcohol dependent) and alcohol-dependent individuals. It is concluded that considerable evidence exists to support the notion that some alcoholic individuals may have lowered central serotonin neurotransmission.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement—a reporting guideline published in 1999—there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as currently defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition (DSM-5), is a heterogeneous disorder stemming from a complex interaction of neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors. As a result of this heterogeneity, there is no one treatment for AUD that will work for everyone. During the past 2 decades, efforts have been made to develop a menu of medications to give patients and clinicians more choices when seeking a therapy that is both effective and which has limited side effects. To date, 3 medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcohol dependence: disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. In addition to these approved medications, researchers have identified new therapeutic targets and, as a result, a number of alternative medications are now being evaluated for treatment of AUD in human studies. Although not approved by the FDA for the treatment of AUD, in some cases, these alternative medications are being used off-label by clinicians for this purpose. These potential medications are reviewed here. They include nalmefene, varenicline, gabapentin, topiramate, zonisamide, baclofen, ondansetron, levetiracetam, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effectiveness of these medications has been mixed-some show good efficacy with side effects that are mild to moderate in intensity; others have mixed or promising results but are awaiting findings from ongoing studies; and still others show poor efficacy, despite promising preliminary results. Medications development remains a high priority. Key initiatives for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) include supporting the discovery and development of more effective and safer medications, advancing the field of personalized medicine, and forging public and private partnerships to investigate new and more effective compounds.},

  abstract = {Recent studies indicate that ethanol (EtOH) potentiates ion current through the channel associated with the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3)-type serotonin receptor. The present study was designed to determine 1) whether such potentiation occurs in adult mammalian neurons expressing 5-HT3 receptors; 2) whether potentiation is selective for the 5-HT3 receptor, relative to other ligand-gated ion channels; and 3) possible mechanisms by which EtOH potentiates this response. EtOH potentiated 5-HT3 receptor-mediated ion current in freshly isolated nodose ganglion neurons at concentrations similar to those previously reported to be effective in neuroblastoma cells (25-100 mM). Current was blocked by the selective 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 even in the presence of EtOH, and current activated by a 5-HT3 agonist (2-methyl-5-HT) was potentiated by EtOH. Thus, EtOH appears to produce potentiation via an alteration in the function of 5-HT3 receptors and not through an independent effect. gamma-Aminobutyric acidA receptor-mediated Cl- current was not potentiated by EtOH in neurons in which potentiation of responses to 5-HT was observed. Methanol potentiated 5-HT3 receptor-mediated current with a potency lower than that of EtOH. Potentiation by EtOH decreased with increasing 5-HT concentration. In addition, EtOH increased the decay rate of current. EtOH did not alter the reversal potential of the 5-HT3 receptor-mediated current. These observations indicate that intoxicating concentrations of EtOH selectively potentiate 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses by increasing the apparent potency of 5-HT for activating ion current.},

  abstract = {Over the last 20 years, the role of adjuvant pharmacotherapy in optimising outcome in rehabilitation programmes for alcohol-dependent patients has become increasingly evident. New avenues for rational drug treatment have arisen from better understanding of the neurobiological substrates of alcohol dependence, including adaptive changes in amino acid neurotransmitter systems, stimulation of dopamine and opioid peptide systems, and, possibly, changes in serotonergic activity. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. However, there is still no unequivocal evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials that disulfiram improves abstinence rates over the long term. Aversive therapy with disulfiram is not without risk for certain patients, and should be closely supervised. Both naltrexone and acamprosate improve outcome in rehabilitation of alcohol-dependent patients, but seem to act on different aspects of drinking pathology. Naltrexone is thought to decrease relapse to heavy drinking by attenuating the rewarding effects of alcohol. However, data from the naltrexone clinical trial programme are somewhat inconsistent, with several large studies being negative. Acamprosate is believed to maintain abstinence by blocking the negative craving that alcohol-dependent patients experience in the absence of alcohol. The clinical development programme has involved a large number of patients and studies, of which the vast majority have shown a beneficial effect of acamprosate on increasing abstinence rates. Both drugs are generally well tolerated; nausea is reported by around 10\% of patients treated with naltrexone, while the most frequent adverse effect reported with acamprosate is diarrhoea. Another opioid receptor antagonist, nalmefene, has shown promising activity in pilot studies, and may have a similar profile to naltrexone. Data from studies of SSRIs in alcohol dependence are somewhat heterogeneous, but it appears that these drugs may indirectly improve outcome by treating underlying depression rather than affecting drinking behaviour per se. Similarly, the anxiolytic buspirone may act by ameliorating underlying psychiatric pathology. Dopaminergic neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and antimanic drugs have not yet demonstrated evidence of activity in large controlled clinical trials. Trials with drugs acting at serotonin receptors have yielded disappointing results, with the possible exception of ondansetron. Because the biological basis of alcohol dependence appears to be multifactorial, the future of management of alcoholism may be combination therapy, using drugs acting on different neuronal pathways, such as acamprosate and naltrexone. Pharmacotherapy should be used in association with appropriate psychosocial support and specific treatment provided for any underlying psychiatric comorbidities.},

  abstract = {Alcohol addiction is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder according to both phenotype and etiology. Difference in phenotype characteristics manifests in the manner the addiction arises, history of the alcoholic and history of drinking, comorbid disorders, and the phenomenon of abstinence difficulties. Concerning the etiology of alcoholism, the disease itself is considered to be a consequence of an interactive influence of the environment and genetic factors. Numerous researches conducted in the last decades discovered many aspects of the biochemical, cell and molecular bases of alcohol addiction, leading to a conclusion that alcoholism is, like many other addictions, a brain disease. By recognizing alcoholism as a disease which basically implies changes of the neurobiological mechanisms, as well as a clear genetic basis, it was supposed that the disease, having its basis solely in the symptomatology, is essentially heterogeneous. By trying to solve the problem of a clinically heterogeneous nature of the disease during the last fifty years, various sub-classifications of such patients have been suggested. According to Cloninger, subtypes of alcoholism differ also according to changes in the brain neurotransmission systems, i.e. it is supposed that patients suffering from alcoholism type 1 have a more pronounced dopaminergic transmission deficit, while dopaminergic transmission is not disturbed significantly in patients diagnosed with alcoholism type 2, who, however, have a significant lack of serotonergic transmission. In such a way, Cloninger actually presented the basis of the so-called neurobiological alcoholism model. Since he has connected differences in neurotransmission with differences in personality characteristics, this model is also known as the psychobiological model of alcoholism. The characteristic of alcoholism type 1 is avoiding damage (Harm Avoidance, HA) decreased dopamine transmission and increased serotonin transmission, while the significant characteristic of alcoholism type 2 is seeking for excitement (Novelty Seeking, NS), unchanged dopamine transmission and decreased serotonin transmission. These neurochemical differences among alcoholism subtypes represent the basis for a different therapy approach. Intake of alcohol changes different gene expression in the human brain. The inheritance model of alcoholism is not fully explained, however, it is considered that the disease is connected to a larger gene number included in neurotransmission, cell mechanisms and general metabolic function, with a simultaneous influence of the environment. The contribution of genetic factors is stronger in certain types of alcoholism and thus we have been confronted in the last years of alcoholism research with studies researching the connections of some alcoholism subtypes with the polymorphism phenomenon in the genes coding the synaptic proteins included in the alcoholism etiology. The primary role of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the brain is catalysis of deamination of the oxidative neurotransmitter amines, i.e. serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. Thus, this enzyme is the key factor for maintaining cytoplasmic concentration of various neurotransmitters and for regulation of the neurotransmitting synaptic activity. Taken this MAO function into consideration, MAO is the enzyme included in the etiology and pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The finding of the decreased platelet MAO activity in various psychiatric disorders has brought us to the assumption that this enzyme may be a constitutional/genetic indicator (trait marker) or an indicator of disease condition (state marker) in biologic psychiatry. There are only a few studies of alcohol addiction researching the connections of the MAO coding gene polymorphism and alcoholism; however, these studies are primarily related to the variable number of tandem repeats (VTNR) polymorphism in the regulatory gene region for MAO-A, considered to influence the transcription activity/functionality of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Wistar rats can develop a high preference for 3\% alcohol after a period of forced alcohol exposure and 2 days of alcohol withdrawal. If these rats are selected at a medium ({$>$} or = 60\%) and a high ({$>$} or = 85\%) level of alcohol preference, it is possible to study the effects of various compounds on alcohol intake and alcohol preference in rats with two different levels of alcohol preference. With this procedure, it was demonstrated that the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide can reduce alcohol preference at doses {$>$} or = 10.0 mg/kg in the high alcohol preference group, by increasing the water consumption without affecting alcohol drinking. Chlordiazepoxide had no effects in the medium alcohol preference group. The 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluoxetine and citalopram reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in both the medium and the high alcohol preference groups by means of a reduction in consummatory behaviour. Both drugs clearly affected total fluid intake and body weight gain. The 5-HT1A agent buspirone reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in the group of medium alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.0025 and 0.63 mg/kg. The drug did not change water drinking so that total fluid consumption diminished. At doses {$>$} or = 2.5 mg/kg buspirone, there was an increased alcohol consumption. Buspirone was without important effects on the high alcohol preferring rats. The 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron reduced alcohol intake in both the medium and high alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. The drug had no effects on alcohol preference and water consumption. At some doses, there was a reduction in total fluid intake. The 5-HT2/1C antagonist ritanserin reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference at doses between 0.04 and 2.50, and 0.16 and 10.0 mg/kg in the medium and high alcohol preferring rats, respectively. Together with the decrease in alcohol consumption there was an increase in water drinking, leaving total fluid intake unaffected. The activity of ritanserin was less pronounced in the high as compared to the medium alcohol preference group. These results indicate that various serotonergic agents can affect alcohol intake and alcohol preference by different mechanisms of action.},

  abstract = {The consequences of alcohol dependence concern serious health care, social and economic problems. The scope of many studies is to better understand mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction in order to work out new, more effective treatment strategies. Alcohol affects many neurotransmission systems within the brain. In general, acute alcohol enhances inhibitory transmission, up-regulating the GABAergic system and impairing glutamatergic function, therefore interfering the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Chronic alcohol consumption, meanwhile, in order to restore equilibrium leads to neuroadaptive changes caus- ing both decreased GABAergic and increased glutamatergic activity. Also function of other neurotransmitters and modulators is modified by the presence of alcohol, including glycine, adenosine, serotonin and dopamine. Moreover, a significant impact of alcohol on the endogenous opioid system, nicotinic cholinergic transmission and the endocannabinoids system has been also established. At present, only four medications are approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in Europe, that is naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram and the most recent nalmefene. Among other promising strategies the following drugs are mentioned: baclofen, topiramate, ondansetron, aripiprazole, rimonabant and varenicline. Additionally, the role of appetite-regulating hormones, neuroimmune modulators or the body's stress-response system modulators in reducing alcohol consumption is currently of great interest, however, further investigations are needed.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to measure trajectories of craving for methamphetamine during the course of pharmacotherapy trials for methamphetamine use disorder. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Craving trajectories were identified using Group-Based Trajectory Modeling. The association of craving trajectories with drug use trajectories was examined using a dual trajectory model. Association of craving trajectories with other health and social outcomes was also examined. The study used pooled data from five randomized controlled pharmacotherapy trials for methamphetamine use disorder. A total of 866 adults with methamphetamine use disorder participated in randomized controlled pharmacotherapy trials. MEASUREMENT: Craving was assessed weekly using the Brief Substance Craving Scale. Drug use was assessed using urine toxicology. Alcohol- and drug-related problems, as well as psychiatric, medical, legal, employment and relationship problems, were measured using the Addiction Severity Index. FINDINGS: A three-trajectory model with high, medium and low craving trajectories was selected as the most parsimonious model. Craving trajectories were associated with methamphetamine use trajectories in the course of trial; 88.4\% of those in the high craving trajectory group had a consistently high frequency of methamphetamine use compared with 18.7\% of those in the low craving group. High craving was also associated with less improvement in most other outcomes and higher rate of dropout from treatment. In turn, low craving was associated with a rapidly decreasing frequency of methamphetamine use, greater improvement in most other outcomes and a lower rate of dropout. Participants on modafinil daily and ondansetron 1 mg twice daily were less likely to be in the high craving group compared with those on placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of methamphetamine craving in the course of clinical trials for methamphetamine use disorder appear to be both highly variable and strongly associated with greater frequency of drug use, other drug-related outcomes and dropout from trials. Two medications, modafinil daily and ondansetron at a dose of 1 mg two times daily, appear to be associated with greater reduction in craving in the course of treatment compared with placebo. A decrease in methamphetamine craving shows promise as an early indicator of recovery from methamphetamine use disorder.},

  abstract = {Background:               Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid of potential interest for the treatment of substance use disorders. Our aim was to review the outcome measures, surrogate endpoints, and biomarkers in published and ongoing randomized clinical trials.                                         Methods:               We conducted a search in PubMed, Web of Science, PMC, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CENTRAL Cochrane Library, “               clinicalTrials.gov               ,” “clinicaltrialsregister.eu,” and “anzctr.org.au” for published and ongoing studies. Inclusion criteria were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining the use of CBD alone or in association with other cannabinoids, in all substance use disorders. The included studies were analyzed in detail and their qualities assessed by a standardized tool (CONSORT 2010). A short description of excluded studies, consisting in controlled short-term or single administration in non-treatment-seeking drug users, is provided.                                         Findings:               The screening retrieved 207 published studies, including only 3 RCTs in cannabis use disorder. Furthermore, 12 excluded studies in cannabis, tobacco, and opioid use disorders are described.                                         Interpretation:               Primary outcomes were validated withdrawal symptoms scales and drug use reduction in the three RCTs. In the short-term or crossover studies, the outcome measures were visual analog scales for subjective states; self-rated scales for withdrawal, craving, anxiety, or psychotomimetic symptoms; and laboratory tasks of drug-induced craving, effort expenditure, attentional bias for substance, impulsivity, or anxiety to serve as surrogate endpoints for treatment efficacy. Of note, ongoing studies are now adding peripheral biomarkers of the endocannabinoid system status to predict treatment response.                                         Conclusion:               The outcome measures and biomarkers assessed in the ongoing CBD trials for substance use disorders are improving.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: At present, the substances acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are available for pharmacotherapy in alcohol dependence, but clinical studies found only modest effect sizes of these treatment options. AREAS COVERED: This article focuses on current pharmacological treatment approaches for alcohol dependence, which have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). EXPERT OPINION: Besides the opioid system modulator nalmefene, which has recently been approved as a medication for the reduction of alcohol consumption, several compounds have been investigated in patients with alcohol dependence using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. In these studies, the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and gabapentin were found to be effective in improving several drinking-related outcomes, whereas levetiracetam failed to show efficacy in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Clinical studies using (low-dose) baclofen, a selective GABA-B receptor agonist, produced conflicting results, so that results of further trials are needed. Varenicline has also shown mixed results in two RCTs, but might possibly be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence. The α1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin is currently under investigation in alcohol dependence with and without comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Finally, first clinical evidence suggests that the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron might possibly be used in future within a pharmacogenetic treatment approach in alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Medication for the treatment of alcoholism is currently not particularly robust. Neuroimaging techniques might predict which medications could be useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of naltrexone, ondansetron hydrochloride, or the combination of these medications on cue-induced craving and ventral striatum activation. DESIGN: Functional brain imaging was conducted during alcohol cue presentation. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the general community following media advertisement. Experimental procedures were performed in the magnetic resonance imaging suite of a major training hospital and medical research institute. PATIENTS: Ninety non-treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent (by DSM-IV criteria) and 17 social drinking ({$<$} 14 drinks per week) paid volunteers recruited through advertisements at an academic center. INTERVENTIONS: A taste of alcohol and a series of alcohol-related pictures, neutral beverage pictures, and visual control images were provided to volunteers after 7 days of double-blind randomly assigned daily dosing with 50 mg of naltrexone (n = 23), 0.50 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride (n = 23), the combination of the 2 medications (n = 20), or matching placebos (n = 24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in brain blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance when viewing alcohol pictures vs neutral beverage pictures with a particular focus on ventral striatum activity comparison across medication groups. Self-ratings of alcohol craving. RESULTS: The combination treatment decreased craving for alcohol. Naltrexone with (P = .02) or without (P = .049) ondansetron decreased alcohol cue-induced activation of the ventral striatum. Ondansetron by itself was similar to naltrexone and the combination in the overall analysis but intermediate in a region-specific analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with animal data that suggest that both naltrexone and ondansetron reduce alcohol-stimulated dopamine output in the ventral striatum, the current study found evidence that these medications, alone or in combination, could decrease alcohol cue-induced activation of the ventral striatum, consistent with their putative treatment efficacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have examined the use of theoretically supported combinations of drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. This review seeks to examine the strengths and limitations of current clinical evidence for the use of combined pharmacological interventions intended to treat alcohol use disorder. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify combinations of pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder, and assess the strength of clinical evidence for these treatments. METHODS: We conducted searches using PubMed, EMBASE® through Ovid® (1974 to present), MEDLINE® through Ovid® (1946 to present), and Psychinfo® through Ovid® (1806 to present). Our primary search included the terms "alcoholism" and "drug therapy, combination". Search results were restricted to human subjects and English language. Search criteria were not restricted based on study design or patient age. Studies were evaluated for randomization, blinding, group similarity, power determination, outcome reporting, and number of patients analyzed. RESULTS: Nine hundred and eighty-four publications were initially screened for inclusion after duplicates were removed. The search identified 16 publications evaluating drug combinations for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. The majority of published trials included naltrexone combined with one of the following: gabapentin, ondansetron, acamprosate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, sertraline, quetiapine, or escitalopram plus gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Other combinations included 5-hydroxytryptophan with carbidopa/levodopa, gamma-hydroxybutyrate with disulfiram, acamprosate with disulfiram, and mirtazapine with quetiapine. Interpretation of results across studies was limited by low statistical power, and heterogeneity of drug combinations and outcome measures. Drug combination effect sizes were comparable to those observed in single-agent trials. CONCLUSIONS: No significant benefit for the use of combinations over single agents was observed. However, benefit may be observed when combined pharmacological interventions address specific symptoms of alcohol use disorder known to be influenced by combination components, or when combinations are used in specific subpopulations in which combination components demonstrate benefit.},

  abstract = {Variations in serotonin neurotransmission influence alcohol consumption (AC). Levels of 5-HT and metabolites are low in some brain regions of alcohol preferring rats and in CSF of alcoholics. Pharmacological treatments which enhance serotonergic neurotransmission (uptake inhibitors, releasers, agonists) consistently reduce AC in rats. Serotonin uptake inhibitors (SUI; e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine) have been studied extensively in humans. In several double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials, SUI have consistently decreased AC by averages of 15\% to 20\% in nondepressed mildly/moderately dependent alcoholics who received no other treatment. Effects were dose-dependent and not related to side effects (few and mild) or changes in anxiety or depression (not observed). SUI also decreased desire to drink and liking for alcohol, thus suggesting a mechanism for effects. Other drugs acting on the 5-HT system have been tested in humans, but results are difficult to interpret. For example, buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, reduced anxiety and alcohol craving, but not AC; a 5-HT partial agonist, m-CPP, increased alcohol craving in abstinent alcoholics; modest reductions in AC were observed with a 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron (0.5 mg/day, but not 4 mg/day). The therapeutic potentials of these medications are being studied. For example, SUI effects on AC were enhanced by a brief psychosocial intervention. Since SUI decrease urge to drink, they may be suitable pharmacological adjuncts in relapse prevention strategies. SUI and other serotonin-altering medications are promising new neuropharmacological treatments for reducing AC.},

  abstract = {The relationship between serotonin neurotransmission and alcohol consumption (AC) was first determined in preclinical studies. AC generally increases following treatments which decrease serotonin activity, and levels of 5-HT and metabolites are low in some brain regions of alcohol-preferring rats. Pharmacological treatments which enhance serotonergic neurotransmission (uptake inhibitors, releasers, agonists) consistently reduce AC in rats. Serotonin uptake inhibitors (SUI; e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine) have been studied extensively in humans. In several double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trials, SUI consistently decreased short-term (2-4 weeks) AC by averages of 15\% to 20\% in nondepressed mildly/moderately dependent alcoholics who received no other treatment. Some subjects decreased AC by up to 60\%. The effects of SUI on AC were dose-dependent and not related to side effects (few and mild) or changes in anxiety or depression (not observed). SUI decreased desire to drink and liking for alcohol, suggesting a mechanism of action, to be considered in the development of treatments to reduce AC and prevent relapse. However, while an adjunctive brief psychosocial intervention enhanced the short-term effect of a SUI, the long-term (12-week) effects of SUI and placebo were similar. Other drugs acting on the 5-HT system have been tested in humans, but results are inconclusive. For example, buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, reduced anxiety and alcohol craving, but not AC; a 5-HT partial agonist, m-CPP, increased craving in abstinent alcoholics; modest reductions in AC were observed with a 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron (0.5 mg/day, but not 4 mg/day). Ritanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, reduced desire to drink and prevented relapse in a small (n = 5) study, and there was some indication that it reduced desire to drink and enhanced alcohol effects without reducing AC, in another study. The therapeutic potential of these medications is being studied. SUI and other serotonin-altering medications are promising new neuropharmacological treatments for AC.},

  abstract = {Ondansetron is a commonly used antiemetic in the emergency department despite a 2011 FDA warning regarding dose-related QTc prolongation and torsades des pointes (TdP). Cases of TdP from small ondansetron doses administered in the emergency department are lacking. A 41-year-old-woman with alcohol use disorder on no medications or supplements presented to an emergency department with one day of nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Examination revealed a pulse of 77 beats/min and epigastric tenderness. The patient received 4~mg IV ondansetron, 30~mg IV ketorolac, and was placed on cardiac monitoring. ECG obtained one minute after ondansetron demonstrated premature ventricular contractions with QTc~=~653~ms. Thirteen minutes after receiving ondansetron she suffered TdP and cardiac arrest. She received immediate CPR and IV epinephrine with successful defibrillation at one minute. She then received IV magnesium. Post-arrest ECGs demonstrated persistent QTc prolongation immediately and at three hours post-arrest. Laboratory studies, drawn prior to arrest, demonstrated hypokalemia (3.2~mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (1.3~mg/dL), and elevated lipase (4918~IU/L). She received no additional QT-prolonging agents. Transthoracic echocardiogram and troponins were normal; ECG intervals completely normalized within 12~h and she was discharged neurologically intact. The patient returned 18~months later with recurrent pancreatitis and similar electrolyte abnormalities; QT-prolonging drugs were avoided at that time and her course was uncomplicated. QT prolongation with subsequent torsades des pointes and cardiac arrest may occur in high-risk patients receiving small doses of ondansetron. Further studies are warranted to determine the safest antiemetic for use in the emergency department.},

Their efficacy though real remains limited and it is useful to develop other molecules. Some products are at present under evaluation, and are already or could be used in the near future in the treatment of alcohol dependence: baclofene, oxybate de sodium (GHB), nalmefene, topiramate, ondansetron and aripiprazole. The available studies on these molecules are still limited and the results sometimes clinically modest. Nevertheless, some of them open interesting future prospects. If there is no big revolution to wait in the short term in the treatment of alcohol dependence, we can consider some interesting orientations: better effectiveness on alcohol consumption, but also change of paradigm concerning the objectives and the methods of this treatment: reduction of consumption versus abstinence, treatment on request, choice of the molecule guided by objective criteria (psychosocial, biological, genetic...).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that ondansetron was efficacious at treating early-onset ({$<$} or =25-years old) but not late-onset ({$>$} or =26-years old) alcoholics in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 321 enrolled patients, 271 of them randomized). Randomized participants underwent 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron (1, 4, or 16 microg/kg twice daily; n = 67, 77, and 71, respectively) or identical placebo (n = 56), plus weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: For this study, we reanalyzed the original sample to determine whether the Type A/B typological classification predicts ondansetron treatment response. In this comparative analysis, k-means clustering was applied to 19 baseline measures of drinking behavior, psychopathology, and social functioning, similar to those used by Babor in the original typological derivation. A 2-factor solution described robustly 2 groups phenomenologically consistent with Type A/B classification. Subjects were subdivided into early- and late-onset alcoholics. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of Type B subjects had early-onset alcoholism (EOA); 67\% of Type A subjects had late-onset alcoholism (LOA). The A/B typology better discriminated 2 clusters based upon baseline severity of alcoholism. There was a significant effect (p {$<$} 0.05) for Type B alcoholics to respond to ondansetron (4 microg/kg); however, Type A alcoholics receiving ondansetron showed no beneficial effect. Early-onset vs. late-onset classification predicted ondansetron response substantially better than Type A/B classification, which did not add to the prediction of treatment outcome. Further analyses showed that ondansetron was effective in the 33\% of Type A alcoholics with EOA but ineffective in the 28\% of Type B alcoholics with LOA. CONCLUSIONS: Type A/B classification best discriminates alcoholic subtypes based upon baseline severity. Early- vs. late-onset classification is, however, a better predictor of response to ondansetron treatment because it might be more closely related to fundamental neurobiological processes associated with the underlying pathophysiology of alcoholism.},

  abstract = {Paucity of sensitive biomarkers to quantify transient changes in alcohol consumption level remains a critical barrier for the development of efficacious therapeutic agents to treat alcoholism. Recently, in an 11-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 283 alcohol-dependent individuals, we demonstrated that ondansetron was efficacious at reducing the severity of drinking (measured as drinks per drinking day; DDD) in alcoholics carrying the LL compared with the LS/SS genotype of the serotonin transporter gene, 5'-HTTLPR. Using peripheral blood samples from a cohort of 41 of these subjects, we determined whether there was a relationship between mRNA expression level of the 5'-HTTLPR genotypes (measured at weeks 0, 4, and 11) and self-reported alcohol consumption following treatment with either ondansetron (4\,μg/kg twice daily; N\,=\,19) or placebo (N\,=\,22). Using a mixed-effects linear regression model, we analyzed the effects of DDD and 5'-HTTLPR genotypes on mRNA expression levels within and between the ondansetron and placebo groups. We found a significant three-way interaction effect of DDD, 5'-HTTLPR genotypes, and treatment on mRNA expression levels (p\,=\,0.0396). Among ondansetron but not placebo recipients, there was a significant interaction between DDD and 5'-HTTLPR genotype (p\,=\,0.0385 and p\,=\,0.7938, respectively). In the ondansetron group, DDD was associated positively with mRNA levels at a greater rate of expression alteration per standard drink in those with the LL genotype (slope\,=\,+1.1698 in ln scale). We suggest that the combination of the LL genotype and 5'-HTTLPR mRNA expression levels might be a promising and novel biomarker to quantify drinking severity in alcoholics treated with ondansetron.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a previous study, ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, reduced drinking intensity (drinks/drinking day [DPDD]) among European-ancestry (EA) participants with moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) and variants in genes encoding the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and 5-HT3A (HTR3A), and 5-HT3B (HTR3B) receptors. We tested whether (1) ondansetron reduces DPDD among individuals of either European or African ancestry (AA), and (2) that reductions in DPDD are greatest among ondansetron-treated individuals with population-specific combinations of genotypes at SLC6A4, HTR3A, and HTR3B. METHODS: In this 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, adults with AUD were randomized to receive low-dose oral ondansetron (0.33\,mg twice daily) or placebo stratified by "responsive" versus "nonresponsive" genotype defined using population-specific genotypes at the three genetic loci. Generalized estimating equation regression models and a modified intent-to-treat analysis were used to compare the treatment groups on the primary outcome-DPDD-and two secondary outcomes-heavy drinking days per week [HDD] and drinks per day [DPD] across the 16\,weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Of 296 prospective participants screened, 95 (58 EA and 37 AA) were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. In the modified intent-to-treat analysis, the ondansetron group averaged 0.40 more DPDD (p~=~0.51), 1.35 times as many HDD (p~=~0.16), and 1.06 times as many DPD (p~=~0.59) as the placebo group. There were no significant interactions with genotype. There were no study-related serious adverse events (AEs) and similar proportions of participants in the two treatment groups experienced AEs across organ systems. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that low-dose oral ondansetron is beneficial in the treatment of AUD, irrespective of genotype, thus failing to confirm prior study findings. However, the study was underpowered to identify medication by genotype interactions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The number of published systematic reviews of studies of healthcare interventions has increased rapidly and these are used extensively for clinical and policy decisions. Systematic reviews are subject to a range of biases and increasingly include non-randomised studies of interventions. It is important that users can distinguish high quality reviews. Many instruments have been designed to evaluate different aspects of reviews, but there are few comprehensive critical appraisal instruments. AMSTAR was developed to evaluate systematic reviews of randomised trials. In this paper, we report on the updating of AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable more detailed assessment of systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both. With moves to base more decisions on real world observational evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will assist decision makers in the identification of high quality systematic reviews, including those based on non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions\emph{.}{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug discrimination studies using selective antagonists and agonists have suggested that 5-HT3 receptors may modulate ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects. However, conflicting data between laboratories leaves the issue of 5-HT3 receptor involvement in ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects in question. The present study utilized transgenic mice that over-express 5-HT3 receptors in conjunction with traditional pharmacological techniques to examine the contribution of 5-HT3 receptors to ethanol's discriminative stimulus. METHODS: Ten 5-HT3 over-expressing (5-HT3 OE) and 18 B6SJL wild-type (WT) mice were trained to discriminate 1.5 g/kg ethanol from saline in daily 15 min, milk reinforced operant sessions. After training, ethanol substitution and response-rate suppression dose response curves were determined for ethanol, midazolam, dizocilpine, cocaine, mCPP, MD-354, YC-30 and MDL-72222. Antagonism tests combining ethanol with MDL-72222 and ondansetron were also conducted. RESULTS: The 5-HT3 OE and WT mice learned the ethanol discrimination in a comparable number of training sessions. Similar patterns of substitution were generated in both groups of mice for most test drugs. 5-HT3 OE mice were more sensitive to the rate suppressing effects of dizocilpine and MDL-72222 than were WT mice. Neither of the 5-HT3 antagonist tested significantly attenuated ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects in either 5-HT3 OE or WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study are consistent with a minimal role of 5-HT3 receptors in transducing ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects. Over-expression of 5-HT3 receptors does not alter the relative efficacy of GABAA positive modulators or NMDA antagonists for producing ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects. However, 5-HT3 receptor over-expression does appear to modulate the response-rate altering effects of the uncompetitive NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine, and the 5-HT3 antagonist, MDL-72222.},

  abstract = {AIM: In this review, the author focused on anticraving therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD) defined by DMS-5. A comprehensive review was carried out on the available published papers on anticraving drugs for treating AUD patients. METHODS: The author described all drugs with anticraving benefits for treating AUD patients approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency of the European Union. Then, the commonly prescribed anticraving drugs and those under development were also described. RESULTS: The US FDA-approved anticraving drugs included acamprosate and naltrexone, and those approved by European Medicines Agency were gamma-hydroxybutyrate and nalmefene. The author also highlighted topiramate, gabapentin, ondansetron, LY196044, ifenprodil, varenicline, ABT-436, mifepristone, citicoline, and baclofen. The putative mechanisms of action of and the use in clinical practice of those anticraving drugs were also described. CONCLUSION: Although slowly developing, the field of anticraving drugs is getting into shape as a promising entity of a pharmaceutical class of drugs. Then, the author addressed on the underused issues of those recommended, and suggested anticraving drugs by the practice guideline of the American Psychiatric Association. The author urges that clinicians should be more "adventurous" in prescribing those promising drugs because benefits of those anticraving drugs are far-outweighing the possible side effects of anticraving drugs, or the harms of untreated AUD itself.},

  abstract = {Aims: We investigated whether reduced anxiety predicted improved drinking outcomes over and above age of onset and ondansetron treatment among alcoholics enrolled in a clinical trial. Methods: Study design was a 2 (early onset alcoholics versus late onset alcoholics) × 4 (placebo and ondansetron 1, 4 and 16 μg/kg twice daily) factorial randomized clinical trial during which all participants received weekly group cognitive behavioural therapy. Using weighted least squares regression, we examined the effects of ondansetron dose, age of onset, pre-treatment drinking and anxiety level (measured by Profile of Mood States) on end-state drinking behaviour. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ondansetron dose, age of onset and pre-treatment drinking influence end-state drinking behaviour. Results and conclusions: The present study added to our previous knowledge, indicating that when change in anxiety level was included as a predictor of end-state drinking, it also accounted for a significant proportion of the variance. Those who experienced decreases in anxiety during the treatment reported fewer drinks per day at their last visit compared with those who reported increases in anxiety.

For this 2016 revision, we performed a systematic review (MEDLINE/PUBMED database, Cochrane Library) of all available publications pertaining to the biological treatment of alcoholism and extracted data from national guidelines. The Task Force evaluated the identified literature with respect to the strength of evidence for the efficacy of each medication and subsequently categorised it into six levels of evidence (A-F) and five levels of recommendation (1-5). Thus, the current guidelines provide a clinically and scientifically relevant, evidence-based update of our earlier recommendations. These guidelines are intended for use by clinicians and practitioners who evaluate and treat people with alcohol use disorders and are primarily concerned with the biological treatment of adults with such disorders.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Only a few medications are available for the treatment of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Areas covered: This paper discusses approved AUD medications, including the opioid antagonists naltrexone and nalmefene (the latter is licensed for reduction of alcohol consumption only), the putative glutamate receptor antagonist acamprosate and the aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram. It also covers off-label medications of interest, including topiramate, gabapentin, ondansetron, varenicline, baclofen, sodium oxybate and antidepressants. Clinical implications, benefits and risks of treatment are discussed. Expert opinion: Acamprosate, naltrexone, nalmefene and disulfiram are the only approved 'alcohol-specific' drugs. Acamprosate and naltrexone have been evaluated in numerous clinical trials and represent evidence-based treatments in AUDs. Nalmefene use, however, is controversial. Supervised disulfiram is a second-line treatment approach. Compounds developed and licensed for different neuropsychiatric disorders are potential alternatives. Encouraging results have been reported for topiramate, gabapentin and also varenicline, which might be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence. The GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-B receptor agonist baclofen has shown mixed results; it is currently licensed for the treatment of AUDs in France only. Gabapentin may be close to approval in the USA. Further studies of these novel treatment approaches in AUDs are needed.},

  abstract = {There is considerable evidence that serotonin-3 (5-HTs) receptor antagonists modulate some of the behavioral effects of alcohol, and may decrease alcohol consumption. To better clarify the mechanism of action of 5-HTs antagonists on these behaviors, we investigated the effects of the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, on several subjective and objective measures of alcohol intoxication in social drinkers. Twelve nonalcoholic, social drinkers received either 8 mg ondansetron, p.o., or placebo during one of two test sessions in a crossover, double-blind protocol. Both conditions were followed by a standard, intoxicating dose of alcohol. Subjective and objective measures of intoxication including mood, physical sensations, performance changes, and alcohol pharmacokinetics were determined. To control for ondansetron effects, 10 additional subjects received either ondansetron or placebo, followed by a nonintoxicating, "placebo" dose of alcohol during a second crossover double-blind protocol. Ondansetron was found to augment certain stimulant, sedative, and discriminant effects of alcohol, without affecting psychomotor performance or alcohol pharmacokinetics. Ondansetron had minimal effects on subjects receiving placebo alcohol. These data suggest that the reductions in alcohol consumption observed in animals and humans treated with ondansetron may be mediated by increases in subjective intoxication, and\textasciitilde or increases in the aversive effects of alcohol.},

Three of the four medications approved in the United States or Europe for treating alcoholism are reported to reduce craving; these include naltrexone (ReVia), acamprosate, and tiapride. The remaining medication, disulfiram (Antabuse), may also possess some anticraving activity. Additional medications that have been investigated include ritanserin, which has not been shown to decrease craving or drinking levels in humans, and ondansetron, which shows promise for treating early onset alcoholics, who generally respond poorly to psychosocial treatment alone. Use of anticraving medications in combination (e.g., naltrexone plus acamprosate) may enhance their effectiveness. Future studies should address such issues as optimal dosing regimens and the development of strategies to enhance patient compliance.},

More recently, variability in the transporter gene was identified to be a potential moderator of treatment response to serotonergic medications such as ondansetron and sertraline. There is an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR) of the SLC6A4, with the most common alleles being a 14-repeat short (S) allele and a 16-repeat long (L) allele. The S allele has often been associated with AD. By contrast, the L allele has been associated with pharmacological responsiveness in some individuals with AD. Differences in clinical phenotype may determine the utility of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism as a moderator of pharmacological interventions for AD. We review the AD typology and disease onset in the context of pharmacogenetic and genomic studies that examine the utility of 5-HTTLPR in improving treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective: Despite extensive research exploring affect in alcohol-dependent individuals in recovery, empirical research on affective changes over the course of psychosocial treatment and their role on drinking outcomes has been minimal. The present study examined the relationship between changes in positive affect (PA), negative affect (NA), and drinking outcomes during a pharmacobehavioral trial. Method: Data for these post hoc exploratory analyses were derived from a clinical trial of 321 alcohol-dependent male and female individuals. The study design had 4 treatment arms for medication: 3 levels of dose of ondansetron as well as a control condition (placebo). All participants received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy for 12 weeks. We conducted an exploratory evaluation of changes in negative and positive affect and drinking behavior over time during the treatment phase of the trial using multilevel modeling. Results: Participants experienced substantial reductions in drinking, decreases in NA, and increases in PA over the course of treatment. Individuals who experienced increases in PA over the course of treatment significantly reduced their drinking in subsequent weeks, -whereas those who had reductions in NA only experienced reductions in drinking later in treatment if they also reported increases in PA. These results support the role of affect regulation in treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest that affective change during the course of treatment may serve as 1 potential mechanism of action for changes in drinking behavior. The interaction between reductions in NA and increases in PA may be particularly important in promoting new coping skills and reducing drinking.

  abstract = {The purposes of this review are to convey the current distinction between pathological drug dependence and voluntary drug abuse; to provide an overview of the anatomy and biochemistry of dependence; to discuss the rationale for attempting to prevent relapse by using therapeutic agents; and to describe effective agents that reduce relapse in alcohol- and opioid-dependent people. Drug dependence (formerly called "addiction") has as its essential characteristic "impaired control over use of the drug." Impaired control occurs when pathways are sensitized within the emotional brain, (usually) in genetically predisposed individuals. At the nerve cell level, impaired control occurs because of a type of neural adaptation (change in synaptic plasticity) within the pathway's nerve cells that alters their chemistry. Relapse in alcohol-dependent patients can be prevented by any of several agents that reduce craving for alcohol: naltrexone (ReVia), ondansetron (Zofran), and acamprosate (Campral, not yet available in the United States). Relapse in opioid-dependent patients can be prevented by the full agonists methadone and L-alpha-acetyl-methadol (LAAM) and the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine (Subutex and Suboxone). No other universally effective anti-relapse medications exist for other chemical dependencies.},

Serotonergic and anticonvulsant agents promise to play more of a role in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Three medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat alcohol use disorder: acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone. Acamprosate and naltrexone reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence rates, although the effects appear to be modest. Disulfiram has been used for years, but evidence supporting its effectiveness is inconsistent. Other medications may be beneficial to reduce heavy alcohol use. The anticonvulsants topiramate and gabapentin may reduce alcohol ingestion, although long-term studies are lacking. Antidepressants do not decrease alcohol use in patients without mood disorders, but sertraline and fluoxetine may help depressed patients decrease alcohol ingestion. Ondansetron may reduce alcohol use, particularly in selected subpopulations. Further study is needed for genetically targeted or as-needed medications to reduce alcohol use.},

  abstract = {Dopaminergic systems are thought to play a major role in the stimulant and reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol. The present study describes the effects of local perfusion with ethanol (and other alcohols) on extracellular dopamine in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Following the establishment of basal dopamine levels (2–3 h), various concentrations of ethanol in artificial CSF (0.01–10\% v/v) were slowly perfused through a microdialysis probe. Each dose of ethanol was found to increase dopamine concentrations in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens. This increase was dose-related in the striatum. The exclusion of calcium and inclusion of 12.5 mM magnesium in the perfusion medium prevented, or greatly attenuated the ethanol-induced dopamine (DA) release. Thus, the release of DA by ethanol is exocytotic in nature and involves calcium-dependent processes. The other alcohols tested, namely methanol and butanol, demonstrated a structure-activity relationship together with ethanol, in their ability to increase extracellular DA. The relative potency was butanol {$>$} ethanol {$>$} methanol. The diffusion of ethanol into the brain tissue was investigated following perfusion through the probe. Relatively low concentrations of ethanol were found in striatal tissue during perfusion and they declined rapidly with time, following the removal of ethanol from the perfusate. The concentrations of ethanol achieved in brain tissue following focal application through the microdialysis probe were relevant to human intoxication.},

The IP administration of 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg ethanol significantly (p{$<$}0.05) increased the extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT in the ACC whereas the 0.5 g/kg dose caused no change. In general, the extracellular levels of the 3 monoamine metabolites were not altered by IP ethanol except for a slight increase in the levels of homovanillic acid following the 2.0 g/kg dose. Local perfusion of 50 and 100 mM ethanol (but not 25 mM) through the microdialysis probe markedly increased (170–200\% of control) the extracellular levels of DA in the ACC. Only the 100 mM concentration of ethanol altered the extracellular levels of 5-HT (2-fold increase), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Addition of 100 μM ICS 205–930 (a 5-HT3 antagonist) to the perfusate markedly reduced the 100 mM ethanol-stimulated release of DA and 5-HT. Overall, the data suggest that ethanol can stimulate the release of both DA and 5-HT in the ACC and that the action of ethanol within the ACC may be mediated in part by 5-HT3 receptors.},

  abstract = {Introduction For any health intervention, accurate knowledge of both benefits and harms is needed. Systematic reviews often compound poor reporting of harms in primary studies by failing to report harms or doing so inadequately. While the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) helps systematic review authors ensure complete and transparent reporting, it is focused mainly on efficacy. Thus, a PRISMA harms checklist has been developed to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, promoting a more balanced assessment of benefits and harms. Methods A development strategy, endorsed by the EQUATOR Network and existing reporting guidelines (including the PRISMA statement, PRISMA for abstracts, and PRISMA for protocols), was used. After the development of a draft checklist of items, a modified Delphi process was initiated. The Delphi consisted of three rounds of electronic feedback followed by an in-person meeting. Results The PRISMA harms checklist contains four essential reporting elements to be added to the original PRISMA statement to improve harms reporting in reviews. These are reported in the title (“Specifically mention ‘harms’ or other related terms, or the harm of interest in the review”), synthesis of results (“Specify how zero events were handled, if relevant”), study characteristics (“Define each harm addressed, how it was ascertained (eg, patient report, active search), and over what time period”), and synthesis of results (“Describe any assessment of possible causality”). Additional guidance regarding existing PRISMA items was developed to demonstrate relevance when synthesising information about harms. Conclusion The PRISMA harms checklist identifies a minimal set of items to be reported when reviewing adverse events. This guideline extension is intended to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, whether harms are a primary or secondary outcome.},
