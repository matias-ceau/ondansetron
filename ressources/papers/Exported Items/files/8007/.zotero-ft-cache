Abstract

Background: Previously, we reported that ondansetron was efficacious at treating early‐onset (≤25‐years old) but not late‐onset (≥26‐years old) alcoholics in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial (n = 321 enrolled patients, 271 of them randomized). Randomized participants underwent 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron (1, 4, or 16 μg/kg twice daily; n = 67, 77, and 71, respectively) or identical placebo (n = 56), plus weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy.

Methods: For this study, we reanalyzed the original sample to determine whether the Type A/B typological classification predicts ondansetron treatment response. In this comparative analysis, k‐means clustering was applied to 19 baseline measures of drinking behavior, psychopathology, and social functioning, similar to those used by Babor in the original typological derivation. A 2‐factor solution described robustly 2 groups phenomenologically consistent with Type A/B classification. Subjects were subdivided into early‐ and late‐onset alcoholics.

Results: Seventy‐two percent of Type B subjects had early‐onset alcoholism (EOA); 67% of Type A subjects had late‐onset alcoholism (LOA). The A/B typology better discriminated 2 clusters based upon baseline severity of alcoholism. There was a significant effect (p < 0.05) for Type B alcoholics to respond to ondansetron (4 μg/kg); however, Type A alcoholics receiving ondansetron showed no beneficial effect. Early‐onset vs. late‐onset classification predicted ondansetron response substantially better than Type A/B classification, which did not add to the prediction of treatment outcome. Further analyses showed that ondansetron was effective in the 33% of Type A alcoholics with EOA but ineffective in the 28% of Type B alcoholics with LOA.

Conclusions: Type A/B classification best discriminates alcoholic subtypes based upon baseline severity. Early‐ vs. late‐onset classification is, however, a better predictor of response to ondansetron treatment because it might be more closely related to fundamental neurobiological processes associated with the underlying pathophysiology of alcoholism.
