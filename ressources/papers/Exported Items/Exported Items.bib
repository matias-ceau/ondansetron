  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the parallel surge in alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive alcohol management strategies. Low-dose ondansetron (AD04, a 5-HT3 antagonist) was shown recently to be a promising treatment for AUD with a specific genotypic profile (5-marker). The liver safety of AD04 has never been evaluated in subjects with AUD. The aim of the present study was to assess the liver safety profile of AD04 compared with placebo in subjects with AUD. METHODS: Liver biochemical parameters were assessed in subjects with AUD with a 5-marker genetic profile who participated in a Phase 3 randomized controlled trial and received either twice-daily, low-dose AD04 (ondansetron 0.33 mg twice daily) or matching placebo, combined with brief psychosocial counseling. ALT, AST, GGT, Serum Bilirubin, MCV, and Prothrombin were evaluated at weeks 0, 12, and 24. Adverse cardiac events, general well-being, and study completion were also assessed. RESULTS: Low-dose AD04 did not significantly change biochemical markers of liver injury, such as ALT, AST, and Serum Bilirubin. While patients with AUD displayed elevated GGT levels, typically associated with increased alcohol consumption, this parameter remained unaffected by low-dose AD04. Notably, no significant adverse effects were observed due to oral low-dose AD04 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose AD04 has the potential to be a safe treatment option for subjects with AUD and ALD, indicating the need for an RCT for this specific cohort. Such a trial would pave the way for the design of a precision treatment for combined AUD with ALD.},

  abstract = {Background: Recently, we showed by using self-report that combining ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) and naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) was effective at reducing drinking and increasing abstinence among early-onset alcoholics (EOAs), who are characterized by a range of antisocial behaviors and high biological and familial disease predisposition. Here, we investigated whether the self-reported differences in drinking would be corroborated by measurements of serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) level, a sensitive, reliable, and well-validated marker of transient alcohol consumption. Method: An 8-week double-blind clinical trial was performed in which 20 EOAs were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) and naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) or placebo as an adjunct to weekly standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. Serum CDT was assessed at weeks 0 (baseline), 4, and 8. Results: Log serum CDT was significantly lower in the ondansetron and naltrexone group (group mean, 1.44 Ϯ 0.076) compared with the placebo group (group mean, 1.82 Ϯ 0.113), as evidenced by a main effect of group [F(1,15) ϭ 7.2, p ϭ 0.017; effect size ϭ 0.32], visit [F(1,16) ϭ 11.2, p ϭ 0.004; effect size ϭ 0.41], and an interaction between group and visit [F(1,16) ϭ 27.54, p Ͻ 0.001; effect size ϭ 0.63]. Conclusions: The combination of ondansetron plus naltrexone was superior to placebo at reducing serum CDT. This corroborated our self-reported drinking data and demonstrated that the medication combination is an effective treatment for EOAs.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Previously, we have reported that the combination of ondansetron (a 5-HT3 antagonist) and naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) appears to act synergistically at improving the drinking outcomes of early onset alcoholics (EOA). a subtype of alcoholic characterized by developing problem-drinking earlier, antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and biological disease predisposition. Presumably, this medication combination counteracts the interaction between activated central 5-HT3 receptors and the endogenous opioid system during the mediation of alcohol-induced reward. We now hypothesize further that an important mechanism by which the combination diminishes alcohol consumption is through a reduction in craving. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the combination of naltrexone and ondansetron is superior to a placebo at reducing craving among EOA, and the relationship between craving and drinking behavior in both treatment groups. METHODS: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 10 EOA were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 microg/kg b.i.d.) + naltrexone (25 mg b.i.d.) and 10 EOA had a placebo (total n=20) as an adjunct to weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Craving was measured by using the obsessive compulsive drinking scale (OCDS). RESULTS: Craving ratings were scored on four subscales which where derived empirically by principal component structure analysis of the OCDS. EOA who received the medication combination, compared with the placebo, had significantly lower scores on "automaticity of drinking" and "alcohol consumption ". Reduction in automaticity of drinking was correlated with self-reported drinking for only the medication combination group. CONCLUSIONS: By reducing automaticity of drinking, the medication combination presumably decreased drinking salience and intensity. Larger scale studies testing these medications, both alone and together, among alcoholic subtypes are needed to establish and extend these promising findings.},

  abstract = {Ondansetron has been shown to be effective in the treatment of early-onset adult alcohol dependence. To date, no studies have been conducted in adolescents with alcohol dependence to assess the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and potential utility of ondansetron treatment. We conducted an 8week, prospective, open-label study of ondansetron (4 Ag/kg b.i.d.) in 12 adolescents who had alcohol dependence. Oral ondansetron was safe and well tolerated in our sample. Adverse events were mild and resolved quickly without intervention. No subjects discontinued due to adverse events. Intent-totreat analyses showed a significant within-group decrease (improvement) for drinks/drinking day (t= 3.10, df=11, p=0.01), as well as decreases in drinks/day (t= 2.01, df=11, p=0.06) and percentage of days abstinent (t=1.45, df=11, p=0.18). These preliminary data suggest that ondansetron is safe and well tolerated in adolescents with alcohol dependence. Findings of decreased drinking underscore the need for future double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in this adolescent population.},

We conducted an 8-week, prospective, open-label study of ondansetron (4 microg/kg b.i.d.) in 12 adolescents (age 14-20 years) who had alcohol dependence. Results showed that "irresistibility" and total scores as measured by the A-OCDS were correlated significantly with drinking indices (drinks/day, percent days abstinent) at the end of treatment, and that "irresistibility" and total A-OCDS scores decreased significantly by the end of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that the A-OCDS can be useful as an outcome measure in clinical studies of adolescents with alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of patient subgroups to enhance treatment effects is an important topic in personalized (or tailored) alcohol treatment. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify subgroups benefiting from treatment. These novel data mining methods help to address the limitations of traditional regression-based methods that focus on interactions. METHODS: We propose an exploratory approach, using recursive partitioning methods, for example, interaction trees (IT) and virtual twins (VT), to flexibly identify subgroups in which the treatment effect is likely to be large. We apply these tree-based methods to a pharmacogenetic trial of ondansetron. RESULTS: Our methods identified several subgroups based on patients' genetic and other prognostic covariates. Among the 251 subjects with complete genotype information, the IT method identified 118 with specific genetic and other prognostic factors, resulting in a 17.2\% decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days (PHDD). The VT method identified 88 subjects with a 21.8\% decrease in PHDD. Overall, the VT subgroup achieved a good balance between the treatment effect and the group size. CONCLUSIONS: A data mining approach is proposed as a valid exploratory method to identify a sufficiently large subgroup of subjects that is likely to receive benefit from treatment in an alcohol dependence pharmacotherapy trial. Our results provide new insights into the heterogeneous nature of alcohol dependence and could help clinicians to tailor treatment to the biological profile of individual patients, thereby achieving better treatment outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Individuals considered to be early onset alcoholics (EOA) are characterized by an early onset age, a broad range of antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and presumed biological disease predisposition. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, improves drinking outcomes and increases abstinence rates among EOA. Individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of ␤-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in ␤-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. The propensity for naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) to reduce alcohol's rewarding effects and drinking in humans is greatest in individuals with high familial loading. Predicated on the added knowledge that 5-HT3 receptors may themselves mediate alcohol reward via activation of the endogenous opioid system, we hypothesized that the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone would act synergistically and would be an effective treatment in EOA. Methods: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial in which 20 EOA were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) ϩ naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) or placebo as an adjunct to weekly standardized group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Results: At endpoint, subjects who received ondansetron ϩ naltrexone (n ϭ 10), compared with those who received placebo (n ϭ 10), had fewer drinks/day (covariate adjusted mean 0.99 Ϯ 0.60 vs. 3.68 Ϯ 0.63; F1, 16 ϭ 9.35, p ϭ 0.008; effect size ϭ 1.42), drinks/drinking day (covariate adjusted mean 3.14 Ϯ 0.87 vs. 6.76 Ϯ 0.71; F1, 13 ϭ 10.45, p ϭ 0.007; effect size ϭ 1.71), and a trend toward increased percent days abstinent (covariate adjusted mean 69.76 Ϯ 8.64 vs. 48.24 Ϯ 9.12; F1, 16 ϭ 3.58, p ϭ 0.08; effect size ϭ 0.88).

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Early-onset alcoholism differs from late-onset alcoholism by its association with greater serotonergic abnormality and antisocial behaviors. Thus, individuals with early-onset alcoholism may be responsive to treatment with a selective serotonergic agent. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that drinking outcomes associated with early vs late-onset alcoholism are differentially improved by the selective 5-HT(3) (serotonin) antagonist ondansetron. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTINGS: University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston (April 1995-June 1998) and University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (July 1998-December 1999). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 321 patients with diagnosed alcoholism (mean age, 40.6 years; 70.5\% male; 78.6\% white) were enrolled, 271 of whom proceeded to randomization. INTERVENTIONS: After 1 lead-in week of single-blind placebo, patients were randomly assigned to receive 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron, 1 microg/kg (n = 67), 4 microg/kg (n = 77), or 16 microg/kg (n = 71) twice per day; or identical placebo (n = 56). All patients also participated in weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported alcohol consumption (drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent, and total days abstinent per study week); and plasma carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) level, an objective and sensitive marker of transient alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Patients with early-onset alcoholism who received ondansetron (1, 4, and 16 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who were administered placebo, had fewer drinks per day (1.89, 1.56, and 1.87 vs 3.30; P =.03, P =.01, and P =.02, respectively) and drinks per drinking day (4.75, 4.28, and 5.18 vs 6.90; P =.03, P =.004, and P =.03, respectively). Ondansetron, 4 microg/kg twice per day, was superior to placebo in increasing percentage of days abstinent (70.10 vs 50.20; P =.02) and total days abstinent per study week (6.74 vs 5.92; P =.03). Among patients with early-onset alcoholism, there was a significant difference in the mean log CDT ratio between those who received ondansetron (1 and 4 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who received the placebo (-0.17 and -0.19 vs 0.12; P =.03 and P =.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ondansetron (particularly the 4 microg/kg twice per day dosage) is an effective treatment for patients with early-onset alcoholism, presumably by ameliorating an underlying serotonergic abnormality.

  abstract = {Rationale: Early onset alcoholics (EOA) differ from late onset alcoholics (LOA) by having greater serotonergic abnormality, familial history, and a range of antisocial behaviors. Previously, we showed that ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, effectively treated EOA. Proximate motivational drives such as craving could have determined drinking behavior. We therefore investigated whether ondansetron treatment would reduce alcohol craving significantly among EOA. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that the craving outcomes of EOA, compared with LOA, would be differentially improved by ondansetron. We also tested the prediction that craving would be significantly correlated with drinking behavior. Methods: We studied a cohort of 253 out of 321 enrolled alcohol dependent subjects. These 253 subjects were entered into a 1-week lead-in single-blind placebo period followed by 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment. Study design was a 2 (EOA versus LOA){\texttimes}4 medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 {\textmu}g/kg b.i.d){\texttimes}13 (visits) factorial analysis of variance. Craving was measured at each visit using seven visual analogue scales. Subjects received 12 weekly sessions of standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Results: Data reduction by factor analysis of the visual analog scale items yielded one dimension, overall craving. Ondansetron 4 {\textmu}g/kg b.i.d. reduced overall craving significantly among EOA. In contrast, ondansetron (1 {\textmu}g/kg b.i.d.) increased craving significantly in LOA. Decreased overall craving was positively correlated with reduced drinking and negatively associated with increased abstinence. Conclusions: Compared with placebo, ondansetron (4 {\textmu}g/kg b.i.d.) was associated with significant reductions in overall craving in EOA but not LOA, presumably by ameliorating serotonergic abnormality.},

  abstract = {Background:               Early-onset alcoholics (EOA) differ from late-onset alcoholics (LOA) by developing problem drinking during youth, experiencing severe behavioral problems, having a familial disease history, and possessing a tendency toward subsyndromal mood disturbance, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Subsyndromal mood disturbance is, therefore, an important component of the early-onset syndrome and may be mediated by serotonin dysfunction. Therefore, the serotonin-3 antagonist ondansetron, which has been shown to be effective at improving drinking outcomes and promoting abstinence among EOA, presumably by ameliorating serotonin dysfunction, also may exert its beneficial effects by alleviating mood disturbance among EOA.                                         Methods:               After one lead-in week of single-blind placebo administration, subjects underwent 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment using a 2 {\texttimes} 4 factorial design that examined age of onset (EOA versus LOA) and medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 {$\mu$}g/kg twice daily) combined with weekly standardized group cognitive-behavioral therapy. The placebo lead-in week was used to adjust for study entrance effects but not for excluding subjects. Assessments of mood were performed by using the overall score and subscales of the Profile of Mood States both at screening and at weekly intervals during the study.                                         Results:               Subsyndromal mood disturbance was shown to be an important component of early-onset alcoholism. Ondansetron (16 {$\mu$}g/kg twice daily) showed greater therapeutic efficacy at alleviating symptoms of overall mood disturbance, fatigue, vigor, confusion/bewilderment, and depression among EOA compared with LOA. EOA-associated improvements in mood disturbance seemed to be independent of drinking behavior.                                         Conclusions:               Ondansetron has been shown to be an effective treatment for early-onset alcoholism. Ondansetron's ability to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility among EOA may make an additional contribution to its therapeutic effect. Mechanistic studies are needed to delineate more clearly the relationship between serotonin dysfunction and pathophysiology among various subtypes of alcohol-dependent individuals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Severe drinking can cause serious morbidity and death. Because the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-HT function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron. METHOD: The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5'-regulatory region of the 5-HTT gene (LL/LS/SS), with additional genotyping for another functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 3'-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants received either ondansetron (4 {$\mu$}g/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy. RESULTS: Individuals with the LL genotype who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27\%) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73\%) in LL compared with LS/SS individuals. LL individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (9.65\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5'-HTTLPR and rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. LL/TT individuals in the ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The authors previously reported that the 5'-HTTLPR-LL and rs1042173-TT (SLC6A4-LL/TT) genotypes in the serotonin transporter gene predicted a significant reduction in the severity of alcohol consumption among alcoholics receiving the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron. In this study, they explored additional markers of ondansetron treatment response in alcoholics by examining polymorphisms in the HTR3A and HTR3B genes, which regulate directly the function and binding of 5-HT3 receptors to ondansetron. METHOD: The authors genotyped one rare and 18 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HTR3A and HTR3B in the same sample that they genotyped for SLC6A4-LL/TT in the previous randomized, double-blind, 11-week clinical trial. Participants were 283 European Americans who received oral ondansetron (4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) or placebo along with weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Associations of individual and combined genotypes with treatment response on drinking outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Individuals carrying one or more of genotypes rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG in HTR3A and rs17614942-AC in HTR3B showed a significant overall mean difference between ondansetron and placebo in drinks per drinking day (22.50; effect size=0.867), percentage of heavy drinking days (220.58\%; effect size=0.780), and percentage of days abstinent (18.18\%; effect size=0.683). Combining these HTR3A/HTR3B and SLC6A4-LL/TT genotypes increased the target cohort from approaching 20\% (identified in the previous study) to 34\%. CONCLUSIONS: The authors present initial evidence suggesting that a combined fivemarker genotype panel can be used to predict the outcome of treatment of alcohol dependence with ondansetron. Additional, larger pharmacogenetic studies would help to validate these results.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and over 95 million people live with alcohol dependence globally. The estimated heritability of AUD is 50-60 \%, and multiple genes are thought to contribute to various endophenotypes of the disease. Previous clinical trials support a precision medicine approach using ondansetron (AD04, a 5-HT3 antagonist) by segregating AUD populations by the bio-genetic endophenotype of specific serotonergic genotypes and the bio-psychosocial endophenotype of the severity of drinking or both. By targeting the modulation of biogenetic signaling within the biopsychosocial context of AUD, low-dose AD04 holds promise in reducing alcohol consumption among affected individuals while minimizing adverse effects. METHODS: This was a phase III, 6-month, 25-site, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial using AD04 to treat DSM-V-categorized AUD individuals who were pre-stratified into the endophenotypes of heavy or very heavy drinking individuals and possessed a pre-defined profile of genetic variants related to the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor. Participants (N = 303) presented moderate to severe AUD, {$>$}80 \% were men, mostly in their fifties, and {$>$}95 \% were of European descent. Low-dose AD04 (approx. 033 mg twice daily) or a matching placebo was administered twice daily for 6 months. Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment (BBCET [53]) was administered every two weeks to enhance medication compliance and clinic attendance. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in the monthly percentage of heavy drinking days, PHDD (-46{$\cdot$}7 \% (2{$\cdot$}7 \%), 95 \%CI: -52{$\cdot$}1 \% to -41{$\cdot$}2 \% vs. -38{$\cdot$}1 \% (2{$\cdot$}9 \%), 95 \%CI: -43{$\cdot$}8 \% to -32{$\cdot$}5 \%, respectively; LS mean difference=-8{$\cdot$}5 \%; p = 0.03) among AD04-treated vs. placebo-receiving heavy drinking individuals at month 6. Heavy drinking individuals were also less likely to be diagnosed with AUD [Month 1: -32{$\cdot$}0 \% (2{$\cdot$}8 \%), 95 \%CI: -37{$\cdot$}5 \% to -26{$\cdot$}5 \% vs. -23{$\cdot$}2 \% (2{$\cdot$}9 \%), 95 \%CI: -28{$\cdot$}9 to -17{$\cdot$}5 \%; LS mean difference= -8{$\cdot$}8 \%; p = 0{$\cdot$}026)], and improved on the WHO quality of life BREF scale with a significant effect for at least a 1-level downward shift (OR = 3.4; 95 \% CI: 1{$\cdot$}03-11{$\cdot$}45, p = 0{$\cdot$}044). Importantly, heavy drinking individuals, as distinct from very heavy drinking individuals, were the bio-psychosocial endophenotype more predictive of therapeutic response to AD04. AD04 had an exceptional safety and tolerability profile, like the placebo's. CONCLUSIONS: In this Phase 3 clinical trial, AD04 was shown to be a promising treatment for currently drinking heavy drinking individuals with AUD who also possess a specific genotypic profile in the serotonin transporter and serotonin-3AB receptor complex. Using AD04 to reduce the harm of AUD in heavy drinking individuals who are currently drinking, without the necessity of abstinence or detoxification from alcohol use, is an important advance in the field of precision medicine. AD04's adverse events profile, which was like placebo, should enhance accessibility and acceptance of modern medical treatment for AUD by lowering the incorrect but commonly perceived stigma of personal failure.},

  abstract = {Background---Serotonergic mechanisms are associated with the development of alcohol dependence (AD), however, studies evaluating serotonergic medications have produced conflicting results. One hypothesis suggests that differential response may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5-HTTLPR promoter region of the serotonin re-uptake transporter (5-HTT). The L/L genotype is postulated to be associated with early onset alcoholism and the S/S or S/L genotypes associated with late onset alcoholism. The aim of this study was to match and mismatch L/L, S/S, or S/L genotypes with administration of ondansetron and sertraline. Methods---Fifteen nontreatment seeking alcohol-dependent individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive either 200 mg/d of sertraline or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE), then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE. Participants then received the alternate drug for 2 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Results---At the first ASAE compared to sertraline, ondansetron significantly improved drinking outcomes for the L/L genotype for the ASAE volume consumed (100\% reduction based on between-subjects comparison, t= 2.35), and for drinks per drinking day during the 7 days prior to the ASAE (79\% reduction and t= 4.34). Compared with ondansetron for S/S or S/L genotypes, outcomes at ASAE 1 for sertraline and S/S or S/L genotypes are opposite than hypothesized. Overall, subjects reduced drinking across their participation in the trial, as there appears to be an order effect. Conclusion---This study suggests that ondansetron may reduce alcohol consumption in alcoholdependent individuals who have the L/L genotype as measured naturalistically and during the ASAE. By contrast there was no support that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have S/S or S/L genotypes. Evidence in the literature suggests that AD in some individuals may be influenced by a gene by socio-environmental interaction making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. Research must consider that typologies may predict successful treatment of AD in future trials.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One hypothesis suggests that the differential response to ondansetron- and serotonin-specific re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5'-HTTLPR promoter region in SLC6A4, the gene that codes for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). The LL 5'-HTTLPR genotype is postulated to be specifically sensitive to the effects of ondansetron with SS/SL 5'-HTTLPR genotypes sensitive to SSRIs. This study tests this hypothesis by matching nontreatment-seeking alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals with LL genotype to ondansetron and SS/SL genotypes to the SSRI sertraline, and mismatching them assessing naturalistic and bar-laboratory alcohol drinking. METHODS: Seventy-seven AD individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive sertraline 200 mg/d or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE) and then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE. Individuals then received the alternate drug for 3 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Drinks per drinking day (DDD with drinks in standard drinking units) for 7 days prior to each ASAE and milliliters consumed during each ASAE were the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five participants completed the study. The genotype {\texttimes} order interaction was significant, F(1, 47) = 8.42, p = 0.006, for DDD. Three analyses of covariance were conducted for DDD during the week before each ASAE. Ondansetron compared to sertraline resulted in a significant reduction in DDD during the week before the first, F(1, 47) = 7.64, p = 0.008, but not the third ASAE. There was no difference in milliliters consumed during each ASAE. CONCLUSIONS: This study modestly supports the hypothesis that ondansetron may reduce DDD in AD individuals with the LL genotype as measured naturalistically. By contrast, there was no support that ondansetron reduces drinking during the ASAEs or that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have SS/SL genotypes. We provide limited support that ondansetron may reduce drinking in nontreatment-seeking individuals with the LL genotype.},

The main trial was a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled human laboratory study with 77 non-treatment-seeking AD individuals randomized (55 completed, 49 complete data) to receive 200 mg/day of sertraline or 0.5 mg/day of ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE), then placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE, then receive the alternate drug, in a counterbalanced order, for 3 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Results for men were not significant. Women with the LL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving ondansetron and SS/SL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving sertraline (matched), drank significantly fewer drinks per drinking day (DDD) during the 7 days prior to the first and third ASAEs than women receiving the mismatched medication (i.e., sertraline to LL and ondansetron to SS/SL). In a 3way interaction, 5-HTTLPR alleles by DRD4 alleles by medications, women with the LL genotype who received ondansetron and had DRD4 !7 exon III repeats drank significantly fewer DDD as did SS/SL women who received sertraline but conversely had DRD4 {$<$}7 repeats in the 7-day period leading up to the first and third ASAEs. Consistent with these data was a significant reduction of milliliters consumed ad libitum during these same ASAEs. These exploratory findings add possible support to gender and genetic differences among AD individuals in response to serotonergic pharmacotherapies. Future trials should be powerful enough to take into account that endophenotypes and a targeting of serotonergic interactions may be essential to successfully treat alcohol dependence.},

  abstract = {Background: Early-onset alcoholics (EOAs) have a greater familial loading for alcoholism, more severe progression of the disorder, a greater severity of comorbid psychopathology, and a poorer response to treatment than late-onset alcoholics (LOAs). Ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist, was found to be superior to placebo in the treatment of EOAs, but not of LOAs. This study compared the tolerability and potential efficacy of an oral solution of ondansetron in EOAs versus LOAs. Methods: Forty outpatients with alcohol dependence (67.5\% male; 87.5\% European American; 20 EOAs; 20 LOAs) received an oral solution of ondansetron at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily for 8 weeks, together with weekly relapse-prevention therapy. Results: EOAs had a significantly greater decrease in drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and alcohol-related problems than LOAs. Changes in the level of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were consistent with changes in self-reported drinking behavior. Conclusions: An oral solution of ondansetron seems suitable for the treatment of alcohol dependence, yielding findings consistent with evidence from a placebo-controlled trial that ondansetron, at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily, is of value in the treatment of EOAs.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Medication for the treatment of alcoholism is currently not particularly robust. Neuroimaging techniques might predict which medications could be useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of naltrexone, ondansetron hydrochloride, or the combination of these medications on cue-induced craving and ventral striatum activation. DESIGN: Functional brain imaging was conducted during alcohol cue presentation. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the general community following media advertisement. Experimental procedures were performed in the magnetic resonance imaging suite of a major training hospital and medical research institute. PATIENTS: Ninety non-treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent (by DSM-IV criteria) and 17 social drinking ({$<$} 14 drinks per week) paid volunteers recruited through advertisements at an academic center. INTERVENTIONS: A taste of alcohol and a series of alcohol-related pictures, neutral beverage pictures, and visual control images were provided to volunteers after 7 days of double-blind randomly assigned daily dosing with 50 mg of naltrexone (n = 23), 0.50 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride (n = 23), the combination of the 2 medications (n = 20), or matching placebos (n = 24). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Difference in brain blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance when viewing alcohol pictures vs neutral beverage pictures with a particular focus on ventral striatum activity comparison across medication groups. Self-ratings of alcohol craving. RESULTS: The combination treatment decreased craving for alcohol. Naltrexone with (P = .02) or without (P = .049) ondansetron decreased alcohol cue-induced activation of the ventral striatum. Ondansetron by itself was similar to naltrexone and the combination in the overall analysis but intermediate in a region-specific analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with animal data that suggest that both naltrexone and ondansetron reduce alcohol-stimulated dopamine output in the ventral striatum, the current study found evidence that these medications, alone or in combination, could decrease alcohol cue-induced activation of the ventral striatum, consistent with their putative treatment efficacy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that ondansetron was efficacious at treating early-onset ({$<$} or =25-years old) but not late-onset ({$>$} or =26-years old) alcoholics in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 321 enrolled patients, 271 of them randomized). Randomized participants underwent 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron (1, 4, or 16 microg/kg twice daily; n = 67, 77, and 71, respectively) or identical placebo (n = 56), plus weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: For this study, we reanalyzed the original sample to determine whether the Type A/B typological classification predicts ondansetron treatment response. In this comparative analysis, k-means clustering was applied to 19 baseline measures of drinking behavior, psychopathology, and social functioning, similar to those used by Babor in the original typological derivation. A 2-factor solution described robustly 2 groups phenomenologically consistent with Type A/B classification. Subjects were subdivided into early- and late-onset alcoholics. RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of Type B subjects had early-onset alcoholism (EOA); 67\% of Type A subjects had late-onset alcoholism (LOA). The A/B typology better discriminated 2 clusters based upon baseline severity of alcoholism. There was a significant effect (p {$<$} 0.05) for Type B alcoholics to respond to ondansetron (4 microg/kg); however, Type A alcoholics receiving ondansetron showed no beneficial effect. Early-onset vs. late-onset classification predicted ondansetron response substantially better than Type A/B classification, which did not add to the prediction of treatment outcome. Further analyses showed that ondansetron was effective in the 33\% of Type A alcoholics with EOA but ineffective in the 28\% of Type B alcoholics with LOA. CONCLUSIONS: Type A/B classification best discriminates alcoholic subtypes based upon baseline severity. Early- vs. late-onset classification is, however, a better predictor of response to ondansetron treatment because it might be more closely related to fundamental neurobiological processes associated with the underlying pathophysiology of alcoholism.},

  abstract = {Paucity of sensitive biomarkers to quantify transient changes in alcohol consumption level remains a critical barrier for the development of efficacious therapeutic agents to treat alcoholism. Recently, in an 11-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 283 alcohol-dependent individuals, we demonstrated that ondansetron was efficacious at reducing the severity of drinking (measured as drinks per drinking day; DDD) in alcoholics carrying the LL compared with the LS/SS genotype of the serotonin transporter gene, 5'-HTTLPR. Using peripheral blood samples from a cohort of 41 of these subjects, we determined whether there was a relationship between mRNA expression level of the 5'-HTTLPR genotypes (measured at weeks 0, 4, and 11) and self-reported alcohol consumption following treatment with either ondansetron (4\,{$\mu$}g/kg twice daily; N\,=\,19) or placebo (N\,=\,22). Using a mixed-effects linear regression model, we analyzed the effects of DDD and 5'-HTTLPR genotypes on mRNA expression levels within and between the ondansetron and placebo groups. We found a significant three-way interaction effect of DDD, 5'-HTTLPR genotypes, and treatment on mRNA expression levels (p\,=\,0.0396). Among ondansetron but not placebo recipients, there was a significant interaction between DDD and 5'-HTTLPR genotype (p\,=\,0.0385 and p\,=\,0.7938, respectively). In the ondansetron group, DDD was associated positively with mRNA levels at a greater rate of expression alteration per standard drink in those with the LL genotype (slope\,=\,+1.1698 in ln scale). We suggest that the combination of the LL genotype and 5'-HTTLPR mRNA expression levels might be a promising and novel biomarker to quantify drinking severity in alcoholics treated with ondansetron.},

  abstract = {Background: In a previous study, ondansetron, a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, reduced drinking intensity (drinks/drinking day [DPDD]) among European-ancestry (EA) participants with moderate-to-severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) and variants in genes encoding the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and 5-HT3A (HTR3A), and 5-HT3B (HTR3B) receptors. We tested whether (1) ondansetron reduces DPDD among individuals of either European or African ancestry (AA), and (2) that reductions in DPDD are greatest among ondansetron-treated individuals with population-specific combinations of genotypes at SLC6A4, HTR3A, and HTR3B. Methods: In this 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial, adults with AUD were randomized to receive low-dose oral ondansetron (0.33 mg twice daily) or placebo stratified by ``responsive'' versus ``nonresponsive'' genotype defined using population-specific genotypes at the three genetic loci. Generalized estimating equation regression models and a modified intent-to-treat analysis were used to compare the treatment groups on the primary outcome---DPDD---and two secondary outcomes---heavy drinking days per week [HDD] and drinks per day [DPD] across the 16 weeks of treatment. Results: Of 296 prospective participants screened, 95 (58 EA and 37 AA) were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication. In the modified intentto-treat analysis, the ondansetron group averaged 0.40 more DPDD (p = 0.51), 1.35 times as many HDD (p = 0.16), and 1.06 times as many DPD (p = 0.59) as the placebo group. There were no significant interactions with genotype. There were no studyrelated serious adverse events (AEs) and similar proportions of participants in the two treatment groups experienced AEs across organ systems. Conclusions: We found no evidence that low-dose oral ondansetron is beneficial in the treatment of AUD, irrespective of genotype, thus failing to confirm prior study findings. However, the study was underpowered to identify medication by genotype interactions.},

Previous studies suggest that ondansetron decreases alcohol use, particularly in people with specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ondansetron was conducted in 70 outpatients with bipolar spectrum disorders and early onset alcohol use disorder. Outcome measures included alcohol use, assessed with the Timeline Followback method, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology--Self-report, and Young Mania Rating Scale. SNPs rs1042173, rs1176713 and rs1150226 were explored as predictors of response. Participants had a mean age of 44.9 {\textpm} 9.4 years, were mostly men (60.0\%), and African American (51.4\%). Mean ondansetron exit dose was 3.23 {\textpm} 2.64 mg. No significant between-group differences in alcohol use measures were observed. However, a significant reduction in HRSD scores was observed (p = 0.045). Inclusion of SNPs increased effect sizes for some alcohol-related outcomes and the HRSD. Ondansetron was well tolerated. This proof-of-concept study is the first report on ondansetron in bipolar people with bipolar disorders and alcohol use disorder.},
