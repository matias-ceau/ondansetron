## üìù Notes

### Task Management Tips

- **High priority tasks** should be addressed first
- **Dependencies** are noted where applicable
- **Estimated effort** can be added to tasks (e.g., [2h], [1d], [1w])
- **Assignees** can be tagged (e.g., @agent-name)
- **Deadlines** should be realistic and tracked

### Contributing to TODO.md

When updating this file:
1. Mark completed tasks with [x]
2. Move completed tasks to the "Completed Tasks" section
3. Add new tasks as they arise
4. Update progress percentages
5. Maintain chronological order in update log
6. Link related tasks with cross-references

### Priority Definitions

- **Critical**: Required for manuscript submission, blocks other work
- **Important**: Significantly improves project quality, should be done soon
- **Nice to have**: Enhances features but not essential
- **Future**: Interesting ideas for later consideration
