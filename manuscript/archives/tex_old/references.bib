More recently, variability in the transporter gene was identified to be a potential moderator of treatment response to serotonergic medications such as ondansetron and sertraline. There is an insertion-deletion polymorphism in the promoter region (5-HTTLPR) of the SLC6A4, with the most common alleles being a 14-repeat short (S) allele and a 16-repeat long (L) allele. The S allele has often been associated with AD. By contrast, the L allele has been associated with pharmacological responsiveness in some individuals with AD. Differences in clinical phenotype may determine the utility of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism as a moderator of pharmacological interventions for AD. We review the AD typology and disease onset in the context of pharmacogenetic and genomic studies that examine the utility of 5-HTTLPR in improving treatment outcomes.},

Currently, there is limited literature on the pharmacotherapeutic interventions for AUD in the Indian setting. It is imperative to identify the possible variations in their effects from Western studies, and hence the current review was attempted to perform a comprehensive evaluation and critical appraisal of the methodology of the evidence on pharmacological strategies of relapse prevention of AUD in the Indian setting. A total of 18 studies were included in the review. Disulfiram was the most common pharmacological agent to be studied. The initial literature before 2000 focused primarily on disulfiram, whereas the studies in the next decade compared it to acamprosate and naltrexone and emerging interest in anticraving agents such as baclofen and topiramate had been noted over the past few years. No studies were available on newer agents such as ondansetron, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or formulations such as depot and implants. Deterrent agents were found to be better when compared to anticraving agents in terms of abstinence and relapse, whereas the latter were more effective for control of craving. Among the pharmacological agents studied, the greatest evidence exists for disulfiram for relapse prevention which could be due to affordability of disulfiram and social support in the Indian context. The chief methodological limitations include the lack of randomized trials and objective measures for assessing abstinence.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Only a few pharmacological treatments are available for treating alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and nalmefene is EMA-approved in European Union. Off-label medications, such as baclofen, gabapentin, ondansetron and topiramate are medications commonly prescribed for the treatment of AUD. The aim of this review is to give an update on recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and reviews evaluating pharmacological treatment for AUD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A literature search was conducted for pharmacological treatment for alcohol use disorder, published from January 2017 to January 2019. An additional search from two ongoing-study databases was performed. A total of 13 studies, 11 reviews and 7 on-going clinical trials were identified. Interest in studying baclofen as a treatment for AUD was greater compared with other medications, yet with inconclusive results. Three new RCTs of first-line medication naltrexone showed reduction in drinking.
SUMMARY: Three new published RCTs focus on baclofen and naltrexone. These results are consistent with old findings demonstrating that naltrexone reduces heavy drinking. Several RCT on baclofen do not support the use of baclofen for treatment of AUD. Encouraging results have been reported for topiramate, gabapentin and also varenicline, which might be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have examined the use of theoretically supported combinations of drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. This review seeks to examine the strengths and limitations of current clinical evidence for the use of combined pharmacological interventions intended to treat alcohol use disorder.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify combinations of pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder, and assess the strength of clinical evidence for these treatments.
METHODS: We conducted searches using PubMed, EMBASE® through Ovid® (1974 to present), MEDLINE® through Ovid® (1946 to present), and Psychinfo® through Ovid® (1806 to present). Our primary search included the terms "alcoholism" and "drug therapy, combination". Search results were restricted to human subjects and English language. Search criteria were not restricted based on study design or patient age. Studies were evaluated for randomization, blinding, group similarity, power determination, outcome reporting, and number of patients analyzed.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and eighty-four publications were initially screened for inclusion after duplicates were removed. The search identified 16 publications evaluating drug combinations for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. The majority of published trials included naltrexone combined with one of the following: gabapentin, ondansetron, acamprosate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, sertraline, quetiapine, or escitalopram plus gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Other combinations included 5-hydroxytryptophan with carbidopa/levodopa, gamma-hydroxybutyrate with disulfiram, acamprosate with disulfiram, and mirtazapine with quetiapine. Interpretation of results across studies was limited by low statistical power, and heterogeneity of drug combinations and outcome measures. Drug combination effect sizes were comparable to those observed in single-agent trials.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant benefit for the use of combinations over single agents was observed. However, benefit may be observed when combined pharmacological interventions address specific symptoms of alcohol use disorder known to be influenced by combination components, or when combinations are used in specific subpopulations in which combination components demonstrate benefit.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pharmacogenetic studies of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have suggested that the efficacy of treatments for AUD is, in part, influenced by the genetic background of an individual. Since the frequency of alleles associated with pharmacotherapy for AUD varies by ancestral background, the effectiveness of medications used to treat AUD may vary among different populations. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing pharmacogenetic studies of treatments for AUD in individuals of European, East Asian, African, and American Indian/Alaska Native ancestry.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for pharmacogenetic studies of AUD treatment that included individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds.
RESULTS: Pharmacogenetic studies of AUD reviewed here have primarily investigated genetic variation thought to play a role in the response to naltrexone, ondansetron, and topiramate. There is support that the A118G polymorphism should be further investigated in individuals of East Asian ancestry.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Given the lack of pharmacogenetic research on response to AUD medication in ethnic minority populations and the mixed results, there is a critical need for future studies among individuals of different ancestries. More efforts should be devoted to standardizing procedures such that results can be more readily integrated into a body of literature that can directly inform clinical practice.
SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This review highlights the importance for future research to aim for inclusiveness in pharmacogenetic studies of AUD and increase diversity of clinical trials in order to provide the best treatment outcomes for individuals across different racial and ethnic groups.

Despite the increase in the number of affected individuals, there are few effective pharmacological treatment options for substance use disorders. The study of the influence of an individual's genetic features on the treatment response may help to identify more efficacious treatment options. This systematic review focuses on the serotonergic system because of its relevant role in mood and impulse control disorders, and its contribution to the development and maintenance of drug use disorders. In particular, we examine the role of serotonergic genes in the response to pharmacotherapy for alcohol, cocaine and nicotine addiction. Current evidence suggests that genetic variability of the serotonergic biosynthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) genes mediates the efficacy of several addiction treatments, such as ondansetron and disulfiram, and the antidepressants bupropion, nortriptyline and sertraline.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: In this review, the author focused on anticraving therapy for alcohol use disorder ({AUD}) defined by {DMS}-5. A comprehensive review was carried out on the available published papers on anticraving drugs for treating {AUD} patients.
{METHODS}: The author described all drugs with anticraving benefits for treating {AUD} patients approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States ({US} {FDA}) and European Medicines Agency of the European Union. Then, the commonly prescribed anticraving drugs and those under development were also described.
{RESULTS}: The {US} {FDA}-approved anticraving drugs included acamprosate and naltrexone, and those approved by European Medicines Agency were gamma-hydroxybutyrate and nalmefene. The author also highlighted topiramate, gabapentin, ondansetron, {LY}196044, ifenprodil, varenicline, {ABT}-436, mifepristone, citicoline, and baclofen. The putative mechanisms of action of and the use in clinical practice of those anticraving drugs were also described.
{CONCLUSION}: Although slowly developing, the field of anticraving drugs is getting into shape as a promising entity of a pharmaceutical class of drugs. Then, the author addressed on the underused issues of those recommended, and suggested anticraving drugs by the practice guideline of the American Psychiatric Association. The author urges that clinicians should be more "adventurous" in prescribing those promising drugs because benefits of those anticraving drugs are far-outweighing the possible side effects of anticraving drugs, or the harms of untreated {AUD} itself.},

Recently, in an 11-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 283 alcohol-dependent individuals, we demonstrated that ondansetron was efficacious at reducing the severity of drinking (measured as drinks per drinking day; {DDD}) in alcoholics carrying the {LL} compared with the {LS}/{SS} genotype of the serotonin transporter gene, 5'-{HTTLPR}. Using peripheral blood samples from a cohort of 41 of these subjects, we determined whether there was a relationship between {mRNA} expression level of the 5'-{HTTLPR} genotypes (measured at weeks 0, 4, and 11) and self-reported alcohol consumption following treatment with either ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice daily; N = 19) or placebo (N = 22). Using a mixed-effects linear regression model, we analyzed the effects of {DDD} and 5'-{HTTLPR} genotypes on {mRNA} expression levels within and between the ondansetron and placebo groups. We found a significant three-way interaction effect of {DDD}, 5'-{HTTLPR} genotypes, and treatment on {mRNA} expression levels (p = 0.0396). Among ondansetron but not placebo recipients, there was a significant interaction between {DDD} and 5'-{HTTLPR} genotype (p = 0.0385 and p = 0.7938, respectively). In the ondansetron group, {DDD} was associated positively with {mRNA} levels at a greater rate of expression alteration per standard drink in those with the {LL} genotype (slope = +1.1698 in ln scale). We suggest that the combination of the {LL} genotype and 5'-{HTTLPR} {mRNA} expression levels might be a promising and novel biomarker to quantify drinking severity in alcoholics treated with ondansetron.},

	abstract = {Background: Individuals considered to be early onset alcoholics ({EOA}) are characterized by an early onset age, a broad range of antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and presumed biological disease predisposition. Ondansetron, a 5-{HT}3 antagonist, improves drinking outcomes and increases abstinence rates among {EOA}. Individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of ␤-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in ␤-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. The propensity for naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) to reduce alcohol’s rewarding effects and drinking in humans is greatest in individuals with high familial loading. Predicated on the added knowledge that 5-{HT}3 receptors may themselves mediate alcohol reward via activation of the endogenous opioid system, we hypothesized that the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone would act synergistically and would be an effective treatment in {EOA}.
Methods: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial in which 20 {EOA} were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 ␮g/kg twice a day) ϩ naltrexone (25 mg twice a day) or placebo as an adjunct to weekly standardized group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
Results: At endpoint, subjects who received ondansetron ϩ naltrexone (n ϭ 10), compared with those who received placebo (n ϭ 10), had fewer drinks/day (covariate adjusted mean 0.99 Ϯ 0.60 vs. 3.68 Ϯ 0.63; F1, 16 ϭ 9.35, p ϭ 0.008; effect size ϭ 1.42), drinks/drinking day (covariate adjusted mean 3.14 Ϯ 0.87 vs. 6.76 Ϯ 0.71; F1, 13 ϭ 10.45, p ϭ 0.007; effect size ϭ 1.71), and a trend toward increased percent days abstinent (covariate adjusted mean 69.76 Ϯ 8.64 vs. 48.24 Ϯ 9.12; F1, 16 ϭ 3.58, p ϭ 0.08; effect size ϭ 0.88).
Conclusions: Ondansetron plus naltrexone seems to synergistically improve the drinking outcomes of {EOA}. Larger scale studies that test these medications, both alone and together, among various alcoholic subtypes are needed to establish and extend these promising findings.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}: Early-onset alcoholism differs from late-onset alcoholism by its association with greater serotonergic abnormality and antisocial behaviors. Thus, individuals with early-onset alcoholism may be responsive to treatment with a selective serotonergic agent.
{OBJECTIVE}: To test the hypothesis that drinking outcomes associated with early vs late-onset alcoholism are differentially improved by the selective 5-{HT}(3) (serotonin) antagonist ondansetron.
{DESIGN}: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
{SETTINGS}: University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston (April 1995-June 1998) and University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio (July 1998-December 1999).
{PARTICIPANTS}: A total of 321 patients with diagnosed alcoholism (mean age, 40.6 years; 70.5\% male; 78.6\% white) were enrolled, 271 of whom proceeded to randomization.
{INTERVENTIONS}: After 1 lead-in week of single-blind placebo, patients were randomly assigned to receive 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron, 1 microg/kg (n = 67), 4 microg/kg (n = 77), or 16 microg/kg (n = 71) twice per day; or identical placebo (n = 56). All patients also participated in weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: Self-reported alcohol consumption (drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, percentage of days abstinent, and total days abstinent per study week); and plasma carbohydrate deficient transferrin ({CDT}) level, an objective and sensitive marker of transient alcohol consumption.
{RESULTS}: Patients with early-onset alcoholism who received ondansetron (1, 4, and 16 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who were administered placebo, had fewer drinks per day (1.89, 1.56, and 1.87 vs 3.30; P =.03, P =.01, and P =.02, respectively) and drinks per drinking day (4.75, 4.28, and 5.18 vs 6.90; P =.03, P =.004, and P =.03, respectively). Ondansetron, 4 microg/kg twice per day, was superior to placebo in increasing percentage of days abstinent (70.10 vs 50.20; P =.02) and total days abstinent per study week (6.74 vs 5.92; P =.03). Among patients with early-onset alcoholism, there was a significant difference in the mean log {CDT} ratio between those who received ondansetron (1 and 4 microg/kg twice per day) compared with those who received the placebo (-0.17 and -0.19 vs 0.12; P =.03 and P =.01, respectively).
{CONCLUSION}: Our results suggest that ondansetron (particularly the 4 microg/kg twice per day dosage) is an effective treatment for patients with early-onset alcoholism, presumably by ameliorating an underlying serotonergic abnormality. {JAMA}. 2000;284:963-971},

	doi = {10.1111/acer.12759},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Identification of patient subgroups to enhance treatment effects is an important topic in personalized (or tailored) alcohol treatment. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify subgroups benefiting from treatment. These novel data mining methods help to address the limitations of traditional regression-based methods that focus on interactions.
{METHODS}: We propose an exploratory approach, using recursive partitioning methods, for example, interaction trees ({IT}) and virtual twins ({VT}), to flexibly identify subgroups in which the treatment effect is likely to be large. We apply these tree-based methods to a pharmacogenetic trial of ondansetron.
{RESULTS}: Our methods identified several subgroups based on patients' genetic and other prognostic covariates. Among the 251 subjects with complete genotype information, the {IT} method identified 118 with specific genetic and other prognostic factors, resulting in a 17.2\% decrease in the percentage of heavy drinking days ({PHDD}). The {VT} method identified 88 subjects with a 21.8\% decrease in {PHDD}. Overall, the {VT} subgroup achieved a good balance between the treatment effect and the group size.
{CONCLUSIONS}: A data mining approach is proposed as a valid exploratory method to identify a sufficiently large subgroup of subjects that is likely to receive benefit from treatment in an alcohol dependence pharmacotherapy trial. Our results provide new insights into the heterogeneous nature of alcohol dependence and could help clinicians to tailor treatment to the biological profile of individual patients, thereby achieving better treatment outcomes.},

Evidence suggests that alcohol dependence may be inﬂuenced by a genetic interaction that may be gender-speciﬁc with temporal changes making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. The main trial was a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled human laboratory study with 77 non-treatment-seeking {AD} individuals randomized (55 completed, 49 complete data) to receive 200 mg/day of sertraline or 0.5 mg/day of ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment ({ASAE}), then placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second {ASAE}, then receive the alternate drug, in a counterbalanced order, for 3 weeks followed by a third {ASAE}. Results for men were not signiﬁcant. Women with the {LL} 5-{HTTLPR} genotype receiving ondansetron and {SS}/{SL} 5-{HTTLPR} genotype receiving sertraline (matched), drank signiﬁcantly fewer drinks per drinking day ({DDD}) during the 7 days prior to the ﬁrst and third {ASAEs} than women receiving the mismatched medication (i.e., sertraline to {LL} and ondansetron to {SS}/{SL}). In a 3way interaction, 5-{HTTLPR} alleles by {DRD}4 alleles by medications, women with the {LL} genotype who received ondansetron and had {DRD}4 !7 exon {III} repeats drank signiﬁcantly fewer {DDD} as did {SS}/{SL} women who received sertraline but conversely had {DRD}4 {\textless}7 repeats in the 7-day period leading up to the ﬁrst and third {ASAEs}. Consistent with these data was a signiﬁcant reduction of milliliters consumed ad libitum during these same {ASAEs}. These exploratory ﬁndings add possible support to gender and genetic differences among {AD} individuals in response to serotonergic pharmacotherapies. Future trials should be powerful enough to take into account that endophenotypes and a targeting of serotonergic interactions may be essential to successfully treat alcohol dependence.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}: Previously, we have reported that the combination of ondansetron (a 5-{HT}3 antagonist) and naltrexone (a mu opioid antagonist) appears to act synergistically at improving the drinking outcomes of early onset alcoholics ({EOA}). a subtype of alcoholic characterized by developing problem-drinking earlier, antisocial behaviors, high familial loading, and biological disease predisposition. Presumably, this medication combination counteracts the interaction between activated central 5-{HT}3 receptors and the endogenous opioid system during the mediation of alcohol-induced reward. We now hypothesize further that an important mechanism by which the combination diminishes alcohol consumption is through a reduction in craving.
{OBJECTIVE}: To determine whether the combination of naltrexone and ondansetron is superior to a placebo at reducing craving among {EOA}, and the relationship between craving and drinking behavior in both treatment groups.
{METHODS}: We conducted an 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in which 10 {EOA} were randomized to receive ondansetron (4 microg/kg b.i.d.) + naltrexone (25 mg b.i.d.) and 10 {EOA} had a placebo (total n=20) as an adjunct to weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Craving was measured by using the obsessive compulsive drinking scale ({OCDS}).
{RESULTS}: Craving ratings were scored on four subscales which where derived empirically by principal component structure analysis of the {OCDS}. {EOA} who received the medication combination, compared with the placebo, had significantly lower scores on "automaticity of drinking" and "alcohol consumption ". Reduction in automaticity of drinking was correlated with self-reported drinking for only the medication combination group.
{CONCLUSIONS}: By reducing automaticity of drinking, the medication combination presumably decreased drinking salience and intensity. Larger scale studies testing these medications, both alone and together, among alcoholic subtypes are needed to establish and extend these promising findings.},

Here, we investigated whether the self-reported differences in drinking would be corroborated by measurements of serum carbohydrate-deficient transferrin ({CDT}) level, a sensitive, reliable, and well-validated marker of transient alcohol consumption.

Results: Log serum {CDT} was significantly lower in the ondansetron and naltrexone group (group mean, 1.44 Ϯ 0.076) compared with the placebo group (group mean, 1.82 Ϯ 0.113), as evidenced by a main effect of group [F(1,15) ϭ 7.2, p ϭ 0.017; effect size ϭ 0.32], visit [F(1,16) ϭ 11.2, p ϭ 0.004; effect size ϭ 0.41], and an interaction between group and visit [F(1,16) ϭ 27.54, p Ͻ 0.001; effect size ϭ 0.63].
Conclusions: The combination of ondansetron plus naltrexone was superior to placebo at reducing serum {CDT}. This corroborated our self-reported drinking data and demonstrated that the medication combination is an effective treatment for {EOAs}.},

These studies suggest that certain neurotransmitters, particularly those interacting with the opioid, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and monoamine systems, may play a critical role in the expression of alcohol-drinking and other behaviors associated with its abuse liability. Built upon this foundation, important advances have been made in the development of therapeutic medications for the treatment of alcoholism. Of the medications reviewed, acamprosate's potential appears to be the most widely established. In the {USA}, naltrexone was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1995 for the treatment of alcoholism; however, the results of some studies have been less encouraging. Naltrexone's reliance on high compliance rates for efficacy may, eventually, limit its potential in clinical settings offering generic treatment for alcoholism. The relative paucity of dose-response studies on naltrexone's effects in treating alcoholics is an important gap in the literature. Recent data from a large clinical trial suggests that ondansetron, a serotonin3 antagonist, offers new hope for the treatment of early onset alcoholics; a type of alcoholism most difficult to manage with psychosocial measures alone. Different subtypes of alcoholic may, therefore, have varying treatment responses to serotonergic agents. Matching subtypes of alcoholic to effective treatment medications based upon their different biologies remains an important therapeutic goal. Combinations of effective pharmacological agents need exploration as they may prove to be synergistic, and could shepherd in a new era of treatments aimed at multiple neurotransmitter targets associated with the alcoholism disease. The coming decade promises more powerful tools for characterizing drug effects on alcohol drinking, thereby closing the gap between animal models of addiction and the human condition.},

These studies have demonstrated the important role of serotonin pathways, particularly as they relate to dopaminergic function, which mediates alcohol-induced reward associated with its abuse liability. Naturally, this has led to the study of serotonergic agents as treatments for alcoholism.{SSRIs} do not appear to be effective treatment for a heterogeneous alcoholic group. However, they may be useful as treatment for late-onset alcoholics, or alcoholism complicated by comorbid major depression. Buspirone, a serotonin 5-{HT}1A partial agonist, does not appear to be an effective treatment for alcoholics without comorbid disease. Buspirone may, however, have some utility for treating alcoholics with comorbid anxiety disorder. The 5-{HT}2 antagonist ritanserin, at pharmacologically relevant clinical doses, does not appear to be an effective treatment for alcoholism. Ondansetron, a 5-{HT}3 antagonist, is an efficacious and promising medication for the treatment of early-onset alcoholism. Preliminary evidence suggests that combining the mu antagonist naltrexone with the 5-{HT}3 antagonist ondansetron promises to be more effective for treating alcoholism than either alone. The differential treatment effect of {SSRIs} and ondansetron among various subtypes of alcoholic is intriguing. Future research is needed to understand more clearly the molecular genetic differences and the interactions of such differences with the environment that typify a particular alcoholic subtype. Such an understanding could enable us to make comfortable predictions as to which alcoholic subtype might respond best to a particular serotonergic agent, which could then be provided.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The neurobiological basis of alcohol dependence, established pharmacotherapies for alcohol dependence, pharmacotherapies under investigation, and obstacles to treatment are discussed.
{SUMMARY}: Alcohol binds to hydrophobic pockets of proteins, changing their three-dimensional structure and their function. Proteins that are particularly sensitive to alcohol include ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and enzymes involved in signal transduction. Established pharmacologic treatments, notably disulfiram and naltrexone, combined with behavioral therapies, may reduce the amount of drinking, the risk of relapse, the number of days of drinking, and craving in some alcohol-dependent individuals. For many patients, however, these treatments are not effective. Recent advances in molecular and behavior genetics are guiding the development of new drugs; these efforts seek to identify pharmacologic pathways relevant to alcohol dependence and to more effectively match treatments to individuals according to their genetic characteristics. Efficacy and safety concerns for acamprosate have been satisfied; the drug was recently released for marketing in the United States. Medications such as sertraline, ondansetron, topiramate, and aripiprazole represent novel lines of research and are currently being tested for use in the treatment of alcoholism. Even with more efficacious medications, however, a transformation must occur in how alcoholism treatment is viewed, not only by the public but also by clinicians.
{CONCLUSION}: In addition to existing drug treatments for alcohol dependence, many other medications are under investigation, particularly for specific types of alcoholism. Pharmacogenomics is expected to play an important role in this research effort.},

	abstract = {Over the last 20 years, the role of adjuvant pharmacotherapy in optimising outcome in rehabilitation programmes for alcohol-dependent patients has become increasingly evident. New avenues for rational drug treatment have arisen from better understanding of the neurobiological substrates of alcohol dependence, including adaptive changes in amino acid neurotransmitter systems, stimulation of dopamine and opioid peptide systems, and, possibly, changes in serotonergic activity. Disulfiram, naltrexone and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. However, there is still no unequivocal evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials that disulfiram improves abstinence rates over the long term. Aversive therapy with disulfiram is not without risk for certain patients, and should be closely supervised. Both naltrexone and acamprosate improve outcome in rehabilitation of alcohol-dependent patients, but seem to act on different aspects of drinking pathology. Naltrexone is thought to decrease relapse to heavy drinking by attenuating the rewarding effects of alcohol. However, data from the naltrexone clinical trial programme are somewhat inconsistent, with several large studies being negative. Acamprosate is believed to maintain abstinence by blocking the negative craving that alcohol-dependent patients experience in the absence of alcohol. The clinical development programme has involved a large number of patients and studies, of which the vast majority have shown a beneficial effect of acamprosate on increasing abstinence rates. Both drugs are generally well tolerated; nausea is reported by around 10\% of patients treated with naltrexone, while the most frequent adverse effect reported with acamprosate is diarrhoea. Another opioid receptor antagonist, nalmefene, has shown promising activity in pilot studies, and may have a similar profile to naltrexone. Data from studies of {SSRIs} in alcohol dependence are somewhat heterogeneous, but it appears that these drugs may indirectly improve outcome by treating underlying depression rather than affecting drinking behaviour per se. Similarly, the anxiolytic buspirone may act by ameliorating underlying psychiatric pathology. Dopaminergic neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and antimanic drugs have not yet demonstrated evidence of activity in large controlled clinical trials. Trials with drugs acting at serotonin receptors have yielded disappointing results, with the possible exception of ondansetron. Because the biological basis of alcohol dependence appears to be multifactorial, the future of management of alcoholism may be combination therapy, using drugs acting on different neuronal pathways, such as acamprosate and naltrexone. Pharmacotherapy should be used in association with appropriate psychosocial support and specific treatment provided for any underlying psychiatric comorbidities.},

	abstract = {Alcoholism is a major public health problem and resembles, in many ways, other chronic relapsing medical conditions. At least 2 separate dimensions of its symptomatology offer targetable pathophysiological mechanisms. Systems that mediate positive reinforcement by alcohol are likely important targets in early stages of the disease, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. In contrast, long term neuroadaptive changes caused by chronic alcohol use primarily appear to affect systems mediating negative affective states, and gain importance following a prolonged history of dependence. Feasibility of pharmacological treatment in alcoholism has been demonstrated by a first wave of drugs which consists of 3 currently approved medications, the aldehyde dehydrogenase blocker disulfiram, the opioid antagonist naltrexone ({NTX}) and the functional glutamate antagonist acamprosate ({ACM}). The treatment toolkit is likely to be expanded in the near future. This will improve overall efficacy and allow individualized treatment, ultimately taking in account the patient's genetic makeup. In a second wave, early human efficacy data are available for the 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron, the {GABA}-B agonist baclofen and the anticonvulsant topiramate. The third wave is comprised of compounds predicted to be effective based on a battery of animal models. Using such models, a short list of additional targets has accumulated sufficient preclinical validation to merit clinical development. These include the cannabinoid {CB}1 receptor, receptors modulating glutamatergic transmission ({mGluR}2, 3 and 5), and receptors for stress-related neuropeptides corticotropin releasing factor ({CRF}), neuropeptide Y ({NPY}) and nociceptin. Once novel treatments are developed, the field faces a major challenge to assure their delivery to patients.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE} {AND} {OBJECTIVES}: We previously found that systemic injections of the 5-{HT} uptake blocker fluoxetine attenuate intermittent footshock stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in rats, while inhibition of 5-{HT} neurons in the median raphe induces reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In this study, we further explored the role of 5-{HT} in footshock stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking by determining the effects of the 5-{HT} releaser and reuptake blocker dexfenfluramine, and the 5-{HT} receptor antagonists ondansetron and tropisetron, which decrease alcohol self-administration and anxiety-like responses in rats, on this reinstatement.
{METHODS}: Different groups of male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer alcohol (12\% v/v) for 28-31 days (1 h/day, 0.19 ml per alcohol delivery) and then their lever responding for alcohol was extinguished over 9-10 days. Subsequently, the effect of systemic injections of vehicle or dexfenfluramine (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg, i.p), ondansetron (0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 mg/kg, i.p), or tropisetron (0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p) on reinstatement induced by 10 min of intermittent footshock (0.8 {mA}) was determined.
{RESULTS}: Systemic injections of dexfenfluramine, ondansetron or tropisetron attenuated footshock-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Injections of dexfenfluramine, ondansetron, or tropisetron had no effect on extinguished lever responding in the absence of footshock.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The present results provide additional support for the hypothesis that brain 5-{HT} systems are involved in stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. The neuronal mechanisms that potentially mediate the unexpected observation that both stimulation of 5-{HT} release and blockade of 5-{HT}3 receptors attenuate footshock-induced reinstatement are discussed.},

Among the most promising new medications is acamprosate, which appears to decrease the intensity of craving after a person has stopped drinking. Naltrexone ({ReVia}) has been shown to decrease alcohol consumption, although its practical effectiveness may be compromised by poor patient compliance and other factors. Ondansetron shows promise for decreasing drinking and increasing abstinence rates among early onset alcoholics, who respond poorly to psychosocial treatment alone. Researchers are investigating whether the use of specific medications in combination can further enhance their effectiveness.

Pharmacological treatments which enhance serotonergic neurotransmission (uptake inhibitors, releasers, agonists) consistently reduce {AC} in rats. Serotonin uptake inhibitors ({SUI}; e.g., citalopram, fluoxetine) have been studied extensively in humans. In several double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trials, {SUI} consistently decreased short-term (2-4 weeks) {AC} by averages of 15\% to 20\% in nondepressed mildly/moderately dependent alcoholics who received no other treatment. Some subjects decreased {AC} by up to 60\%. The effects of {SUI} on {AC} were dose-dependent and not related to side effects (few and mild) or changes in anxiety or depression (not observed). {SUI} decreased desire to drink and liking for alcohol, suggesting a mechanism of action, to be considered in the development of treatments to reduce {AC} and prevent relapse. However, while an adjunctive brief psychosocial intervention enhanced the short-term effect of a {SUI}, the long-term (12-week) effects of {SUI} and placebo were similar. Other drugs acting on the 5-{HT} system have been tested in humans, but results are inconclusive. For example, buspirone, a 5-{HT}1A receptor partial agonist, reduced anxiety and alcohol craving, but not {AC}; a 5-{HT} partial agonist, m-{CPP}, increased craving in abstinent alcoholics; modest reductions in {AC} were observed with a 5-{HT}3 antagonist, ondansetron (0.5 mg/day, but not 4 mg/day). Ritanserin, a 5-{HT}2 antagonist, reduced desire to drink and prevented relapse in a small (n = 5) study, and there was some indication that it reduced desire to drink and enhanced alcohol effects without reducing {AC}, in another study. The therapeutic potential of these medications is being studied. {SUI} and other serotonin-altering medications are promising new neuropharmacological treatments for {AC}.},

	volume = {28},
	issn = {0735-0414},
	abstract = {Wistar rats can develop a high preference for 3\% alcohol after a period of forced alcohol exposure and 2 days of alcohol withdrawal. If these rats are selected at a medium ({\textgreater} or = 60\%) and a high ({\textgreater} or = 85\%) level of alcohol preference, it is possible to study the effects of various compounds on alcohol intake and alcohol preference in rats with two different levels of alcohol preference. With this procedure, it was demonstrated that the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide can reduce alcohol preference at doses {\textgreater} or = 10.0 mg/kg in the high alcohol preference group, by increasing the water consumption without affecting alcohol drinking. Chlordiazepoxide had no effects in the medium alcohol preference group. The 5-{HT} uptake inhibitors fluoxetine and citalopram reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in both the medium and the high alcohol preference groups by means of a reduction in consummatory behaviour. Both drugs clearly affected total fluid intake and body weight gain. The 5-{HT}1A agent buspirone reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in the group of medium alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.0025 and 0.63 mg/kg. The drug did not change water drinking so that total fluid consumption diminished. At doses {\textgreater} or = 2.5 mg/kg buspirone, there was an increased alcohol consumption. Buspirone was without important effects on the high alcohol preferring rats. The 5-{HT}3 antagonist ondansetron reduced alcohol intake in both the medium and high alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. The drug had no effects on alcohol preference and water consumption. At some doses, there was a reduction in total fluid intake. The 5-{HT}2/1C antagonist ritanserin reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference at doses between 0.04 and 2.50, and 0.16 and 10.0 mg/kg in the medium and high alcohol preferring rats, respectively. Together with the decrease in alcohol consumption there was an increase in water drinking, leaving total fluid intake unaffected. The activity of ritanserin was less pronounced in the high as compared to the medium alcohol preference group. These results indicate that various serotonergic agents can affect alcohol intake and alcohol preference by different mechanisms of action.},

Drug dependence (formerly called "addiction") has as its essential characteristic "impaired control over use of the drug." Impaired control occurs when pathways are sensitized within the emotional brain, (usually) in genetically predisposed individuals. At the nerve cell level, impaired control occurs because of a type of neural adaptation (change in synaptic plasticity) within the pathway's nerve cells that alters their chemistry. Relapse in alcohol-dependent patients can be prevented by any of several agents that reduce craving for alcohol: naltrexone ({ReVia}), ondansetron (Zofran), and acamprosate (Campral, not yet available in the United States). Relapse in opioid-dependent patients can be prevented by the full agonists methadone and L-alpha-acetyl-methadol ({LAAM}) and the partial opioid agonist buprenorphine (Subutex and Suboxone). No other universally effective anti-relapse medications exist for other chemical dependencies.},

The Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})-approved medications naltrexone and acamprosate have shown mixed results in clinical trials. Oral naltrexone and naltrexone depot formulations have generally demonstrated efficacy at treating alcohol dependence, but their treatment effect size is small, and more research is needed to compare the effects of different doses on drinking outcome. Acamprosate has demonstrated efficacy for treating alcohol dependence in European trials, but with a small effect size. In U.S. trials, acamprosate has not proved to be efficacious. Research continues to explore which types of alcohol-dependent individual would benefit the most from treatment with naltrexone or acamprosate. The combination of the two medications demonstrated efficacy for treating alcohol dependence in one European study but not in a multi-site U.S. study. Another {FDA}-approved medication, disulfiram, is an aversive agent that does not diminish craving for alcohol. Disulfiram is most effective when given to those who are highly compliant or who are receiving their medication under supervision. Of the non-approved medications, topiramate is among the most promising, with a medium effect size in clinical trials. Another promising medication, baclofen, has shown efficacy in small trials. Serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, appear to be efficacious only among certain genetic subtypes of alcoholic.

It has a superior efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomic profile compared with other groups of antiemetics, namely antidopaminergics, antihistamines and anticholinergics. However, its place in the management of anticipatory and delayed vomiting in cancer treatment and as a rescue antiemetic in surgical patients needs to be further explored. Furthermore, recent animal and human research also reflects its possible novel application in the treatment of other disease states, such as alcoholism, cocaine addiction, opioid withdrawal syndrome, anxiety disorders, gastrointestinal motility disorders, Tourette's syndrome and pruritus. This review revisits the widespread physiological and pathological effects of 5-{HT} and discusses both the basic science literature and the clinical developments responsible for the conventional and novel uses of ondansetron. In addition, new discoveries relating to the effects of ondansetron on other receptors/channels and their possible therapeutic applications are presented.},

	abstract = {Background: Early-onset alcoholics ({EOA}) differ from late-onset alcoholics ({LOA}) by developing problem drinking during youth, experiencing severe behavioral problems, having a familial disease history, and possessing a tendency toward subsyndromal mood disturbance, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Subsyndromal mood disturbance is, therefore, an important component of the early-onset syndrome and may be mediated by serotonin dysfunction. Therefore, the serotonin-3 antagonist ondansetron, which has been shown to be effective at improving drinking outcomes and promoting abstinence among {EOA}, presumably by ameliorating serotonin dysfunction, also may exert its beneficial effects by alleviating mood disturbance among {EOA}.
Methods: After one lead-in week of single-blind placebo administration, subjects underwent 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment using a 2 ϫ 4 factorial design that examined age of onset ({EOA} versus {LOA}) and medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 ␮g/kg twice daily) combined with weekly standardized group cognitive-behavioral therapy. The placebo lead-in week was used to adjust for study entrance effects but not for excluding subjects. Assessments of mood were performed by using the overall score and subscales of the Profile of Mood States both at screening and at weekly intervals during the study.
Results: Subsyndromal mood disturbance was shown to be an important component of early-onset alcoholism. Ondansetron (16 ␮g/kg twice daily) showed greater therapeutic efficacy at alleviating symptoms of overall mood disturbance, fatigue, vigor, confusion/bewilderment, and depression among {EOA} compared with {LOA}. {EOA}-associated improvements in mood disturbance seemed to be independent of drinking behavior.
Conclusions: Ondansetron has been shown to be an effective treatment for early-onset alcoholism. Ondansetron’s ability to improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility among {EOA} may make an additional contribution to its therapeutic effect. Mechanistic studies are needed to delineate more clearly the relationship between serotonin dysfunction and pathophysiology among various subtypes of alcoholdependent individuals.},

Ondansetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonist, was found to be superior to placebo in the treatment of {EOAs}, but not of {LOAs}. This study compared the tolerability and potential efficacy of an oral solution of ondansetron in {EOAs} versus {LOAs}.
Methods: Forty outpatients with alcohol dependence (67.5\% male; 87.5\% European American; 20 {EOAs}; 20 {LOAs}) received an oral solution of ondansetron at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily for 8 weeks, together with weekly relapse-prevention therapy.
Results: {EOAs} had a significantly greater decrease in drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and alcohol-related problems than {LOAs}. Changes in the level of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin were consistent with changes in self-reported drinking behavior.
Conclusions: An oral solution of ondansetron seems suitable for the treatment of alcohol dependence, yielding findings consistent with evidence from a placebo-controlled trial that ondansetron, at a dosage of 4 ␮g/kg twice daily, is of value in the treatment of {EOAs}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previously, we reported that ondansetron was efficacious at treating early-onset ({\textless} or =25-years old) but not late-onset ({\textgreater} or =26-years old) alcoholics in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 321 enrolled patients, 271 of them randomized). Randomized participants underwent 11 weeks of treatment with ondansetron (1, 4, or 16 microg/kg twice daily; n = 67, 77, and 71, respectively) or identical placebo (n = 56), plus weekly standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy.
{METHODS}: For this study, we reanalyzed the original sample to determine whether the Type A/B typological classification predicts ondansetron treatment response. In this comparative analysis, k-means clustering was applied to 19 baseline measures of drinking behavior, psychopathology, and social functioning, similar to those used by Babor in the original typological derivation. A 2-factor solution described robustly 2 groups phenomenologically consistent with Type A/B classification. Subjects were subdivided into early- and late-onset alcoholics.
{RESULTS}: Seventy-two percent of Type B subjects had early-onset alcoholism ({EOA}); 67\% of Type A subjects had late-onset alcoholism ({LOA}). The A/B typology better discriminated 2 clusters based upon baseline severity of alcoholism. There was a significant effect (p {\textless} 0.05) for Type B alcoholics to respond to ondansetron (4 microg/kg); however, Type A alcoholics receiving ondansetron showed no beneficial effect. Early-onset vs. late-onset classification predicted ondansetron response substantially better than Type A/B classification, which did not add to the prediction of treatment outcome. Further analyses showed that ondansetron was effective in the 33\% of Type A alcoholics with {EOA} but ineffective in the 28\% of Type B alcoholics with {LOA}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Type A/B classification best discriminates alcoholic subtypes based upon baseline severity. Early- vs. late-onset classification is, however, a better predictor of response to ondansetron treatment because it might be more closely related to fundamental neurobiological processes associated with the underlying pathophysiology of alcoholism.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Serotonergic mechanisms are associated with the development of alcohol dependence ({AD}), however, studies evaluating serotonergic medications have produced conflicting results. One hypothesis suggests that differential response may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5-{HTTLPR} promoter region of the serotonin re-uptake transporter (5-{HTT}). The L/L genotype is postulated to be associated with early onset alcoholism and the S/S or S/L genotypes associated with late onset alcoholism. The aim of this study was to match and mismatch L/L, S/S, or S/L genotypes with administration of ondansetron and sertraline.
{METHODS}: Fifteen nontreatment seeking alcohol-dependent individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive either 200 mg/d of sertraline or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment ({ASAE}), then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second {ASAE}. Participants then received the alternate drug for 2 weeks followed by a third {ASAE}.
{RESULTS}: At the first {ASAE} compared to sertraline, ondansetron significantly improved drinking outcomes for the L/L genotype for the {ASAE} volume consumed (100\% reduction based on between-subjects comparison, t = 2.35), and for drinks per drinking day during the 7 days prior to the {ASAE} (79\% reduction and t = 4.34). Compared with ondansetron for S/S or S/L genotypes, outcomes at {ASAE} 1 for sertraline and S/S or S/L genotypes are opposite than hypothesized. Overall, subjects reduced drinking across their participation in the trial, as there appears to be an order effect.
{CONCLUSION}: This study suggests that ondansetron may reduce alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent individuals who have the L/L genotype as measured naturalistically and during the {ASAE}. By contrast there was no support that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have S/S or S/L genotypes. Evidence in the literature suggests that {AD} in some individuals may be influenced by a gene by socio-environmental interaction making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. Research must consider that typologies may predict successful treatment of {AD} in future trials.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: One hypothesis suggests that the differential response to ondansetron- and serotonin-specific re-uptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) may be due to a functional polymorphism of the 5'-{HTTLPR} promoter region in {SLC}6A4, the gene that codes for the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}). The {LL} 5'-{HTTLPR} genotype is postulated to be specifically sensitive to the effects of ondansetron with {SS}/{SL} 5'-{HTTLPR} genotypes sensitive to {SSRIs}. This study tests this hypothesis by matching nontreatment-seeking alcohol-dependent ({AD}) individuals with {LL} genotype to ondansetron and {SS}/{SL} genotypes to the {SSRI} sertraline, and mismatching them assessing naturalistic and bar-laboratory alcohol drinking.
{METHODS}: Seventy-seven {AD} individuals were randomized to 1 of 2 counterbalanced arms to receive sertraline 200 mg/d or ondansetron 0.5 mg/d for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment ({ASAE}) and then received placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second {ASAE}. Individuals then received the alternate drug for 3 weeks followed by a third {ASAE}. Drinks per drinking day ({DDD} with drinks in standard drinking units) for 7 days prior to each {ASAE} and milliliters consumed during each {ASAE} were the primary outcomes.
{RESULTS}: Fifty-five participants completed the study. The genotype × order interaction was significant, F(1, 47) = 8.42, p = 0.006, for {DDD}. Three analyses of covariance were conducted for {DDD} during the week before each {ASAE}. Ondansetron compared to sertraline resulted in a significant reduction in {DDD} during the week before the first, F(1, 47) = 7.64, p = 0.008, but not the third {ASAE}. There was no difference in milliliters consumed during each {ASAE}.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study modestly supports the hypothesis that ondansetron may reduce {DDD} in {AD} individuals with the {LL} genotype as measured naturalistically. By contrast, there was no support that ondansetron reduces drinking during the {ASAEs} or that sertraline reduces alcohol use in individuals who have {SS}/{SL} genotypes. We provide limited support that ondansetron may reduce drinking in nontreatment-seeking individuals with the {LL} genotype.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The authors previously reported that the 5'-{HTTLPR}-{LL} and rs1042173-{TT} ({SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT}) genotypes in the serotonin transporter gene predicted a significant reduction in the severity of alcohol consumption among alcoholics receiving the 5-{HT}3 antagonist ondansetron. In this study, they explored additional markers of ondansetron treatment response in alcoholics by examining polymorphisms in the {HTR}3A and {HTR}3B genes, which regulate directly the function and binding of 5-{HT}3 receptors to ondansetron.
{METHOD}: The authors genotyped one rare and 18 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in {HTR}3A and {HTR}3B in the same sample that they genotyped for {SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT} in the previous randomized, double-blind, 11-week clinical trial. Participants were 283 European Americans who received oral ondansetron (4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) or placebo along with weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Associations of individual and combined genotypes with treatment response on drinking outcomes were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Individuals carrying one or more of genotypes rs1150226-{AG} and rs1176713-{GG} in {HTR}3A and rs17614942-{AC} in {HTR}3B showed a significant overall mean difference between ondansetron and placebo in drinks per drinking day (22.50; effect size=0.867), percentage of heavy drinking days (220.58\%; effect size=0.780), and percentage of days abstinent (18.18\%; effect size=0.683). Combining these {HTR}3A/{HTR}3B and {SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT} genotypes increased the target cohort from approaching 20\% (identified in the previous study) to 34\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The authors present initial evidence suggesting that a combined fivemarker genotype panel can be used to predict the outcome of treatment of alcohol dependence with ondansetron. Additional, larger pharmacogenetic studies would help to validate these results.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Severe drinking can cause serious morbidity and death. Because the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-{HT} function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-{HT}(3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron.
{METHOD}: The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5'-regulatory region of the 5-{HTT} gene ({LL}/{LS}/{SS}), with additional genotyping for another functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 3'-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants received either ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy.
{RESULTS}: Individuals with the {LL} genotype who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27\%) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73\%) in {LL} compared with {LS}/{SS} individuals. {LL} individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (9.65\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5'-{HTTLPR} and rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. {LL}/{TT} individuals in the ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The authors propose a new pharmacogenetic approach using ondansetron to treat severe drinking and improve abstinence in alcoholics.},

Drugs that affect neural pathways that modulate the activity of the cortico-mesolimbic dopamine system have been shown to alter drinking behavior, presumably because this dopaminergic system is closely associated with rewarding behavior. Ondansetron, naltrexone, topiramate, and baclofen are examples. Subtyping alcoholism in adults into an early-onset type, with chronic symptoms and a strong biological predisposition to the disease, and a late-onset type, typically brought on by psychosocial triggers and associated with mood symptoms, may help in the selection of optimal therapy. Emerging adults with binge drinking patterns also might be aided by selective treatments. Although preliminary work on the pharmacogenetics of alcoholism and its treatment has been promising, the assignment to treatment still depends on clinical assessment. Brief behavioral interventions that encourage the patient to set goals for a reduction in heavy drinking or abstinence also are part of optimal therapy.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Early onset alcoholics ({EOA}) differ from late onset alcoholics ({LOA}) by having greater serotonergic abnormality, familial history, and a range of antisocial behaviors. Previously, we showed that ondansetron, a selective 5-{HT}3 antagonist, effectively treated {EOA}. Proximate motivational drives such as craving could have determined drinking behavior. We therefore investigated whether ondansetron treatment would reduce alcohol craving significantly among {EOA}. Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that the craving outcomes of {EOA}, compared with {LOA}, would be differentially improved by ondansetron. We also tested the prediction that craving would be significantly correlated with drinking behavior. Methods: We studied a cohort of 253 out of 321 enrolled alcohol dependent subjects. These 253 subjects were entered into a 1-week lead-in single-blind placebo period followed by 11 weeks of double-blind outpatient treatment. Study design was a 2 ({EOA} versus {LOA})×4 medication dose (placebo, or ondansetron 1, 4, or 16 µg/kg b.i.d)×13 (visits) factorial analysis of variance. Craving was measured at each visit using seven visual analogue scales. Subjects received 12 weekly sessions of standardized group cognitive behavioral therapy. Results: Data reduction by factor analysis of the visual analog scale items yielded one dimension, overall craving. Ondansetron 4 µg/kg b.i.d. reduced overall craving significantly among {EOA}. In contrast, ondansetron (1 µg/kg b.i.d.) increased craving significantly in {LOA}. Decreased overall craving was positively correlated with reduced drinking and negatively associated with increased abstinence. Conclusions: Compared with placebo, ondansetron (4 µg/kg b.i.d.) was associated with significant reductions in overall craving in {EOA} but not {LOA}, presumably by ameliorating serotonergic abnormality.},

	abstract = {Research suggests that alcoholics show comparatively lower levels of serotonin (5-{HT}) than non-alcoholics. Medications aimed at increasing synaptic 5-{HT} have long been studied as potential treatments for alcoholism. Studies with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRI}) in a heterogeneous population of non-depressed alcoholics have produced inconsistent results. Further exploration involved whether or not treatment of co-morbid alcoholism and depression was a more practical approach. However, even in the presence of co-occurring depression, antidepressants in general lack the power to demonstrate a significant reduction of alcohol use among alcohol dependent patients with carefully diagnosed major depression. Further statistical analysis has also determined that perhaps genotypic and phenotypic variations differ for persons with alcohol dependence including those with or without comorbid alcohol dependence and depression suggesting important subgroups might respond differently to treatments. Clinical trials have also used the anxiolytic buspirone, a 5-{HT}(1A) partial agonist, as many alcoholics suffer from anxiety. When controlling for baseline anxiety, buspirone was no more effective than placebo for alcoholic patients. Another serotonergic drug, ritanserin, did not demonstrate effectiveness in relapse prevention in alcohol dependence. However, research on the use of the 5-{HT}(3) antagonist ondansetron for alcohol dependence continues to provide promising results, particularly for patients with early onset alcoholism. As demonstrated by the studies with serotonergics, responses based on individual variables suggest that alcoholics may respond differentially based on various serotonin 5-{HT} subtypes. Of course, future studies need to further delineate and confirm the differences between these alcoholic subtypes.},

In the United States ({US}) and Europe, there are only a few medications approved for alcohol dependence ({AD}) however, these medications have only been moderately effective and there is a crucial need for more effective treatments. This review briefly summarizes research on currently approved medications for {AD}, as well as promising medications like topiramate, baclofen and ondansetron. Topiramate is likely the most promising new treatment for {AD}, however, further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and appropriate length of treatment. Baclofen, a {GABA}(B) agonist, is a promising medication as a treatment for {AD}, especially for patients with {AD} and severe liver disease. Ondansetron has shown promising results as a potential medication for {AD}, but only within a certain subtype of individuals. This review also discusses more recent findings on other potential pharmacotherapies for {AD}, such as serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}; i.e. sertraline), aripiprazole and prazosin, as well as on some examples of other potentially interesting new neuropharmacological targets (i.e. cannabinoid receptors, {CRF}, {NPY}, ghrelin). Finally, the present review also discusses the attempts to personalize medication for {AD} treatment by alcohol typology and pharmacogenetics.},

	abstract = {The 5-{HT}3 receptor is rapidly potentiated by ethanol and mediates fast excitatory serotonin (5-{HT}) transmission that modulates dopamine release in the reward circuitry. The 5-{HT} transporter regulates synaptic 5-{HT} availability. Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding the transporter and receptor may therefore influence addiction vulnerability. In this study, 360 treatment-seeking African American male patients with single and comorbid {DSM}-{IV} lifetime diagnoses of alcohol, cocaine and heroin dependence and 187 African American male controls were genotyped for the triallelic 5-{HTTLPR} functional polymorphism in the 5-{HT} transporter gene ({SLC}6A4) and 16 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) across {HTR}3B (including the functional rs1176744 Tyr129Ser) and {HTR}3A, genes encoding 5-{HT}3 receptors. The {HTR}3B rs1176744 gain-of-function Ser129 allele predicted alcohol dependence (P=0.002) and low 5-{HTTLPR} activity predicted cocaine/heroin dependence (P=0.01). Both the {HTR}3B Ser129 allele (P=0.014, odds ratio ({OR})=1.7 (1.1-2.6)) and low 5-{HTTLPR} activity (P=0.011, {OR}=2.5 (1.3-4.6)) were more common in men with alcohol+drug dependence compared with controls. Moreover, the {HTR}3B Ser129 allele and low 5-{HTTLPR} activity had an additive (but not an interactive) effect on alcohol+drug dependence ({OR}=6.0 (2.1-16.6)) that accounted for 13\% of the variance. One possible explanation of our findings is that increased synaptic 5-{HT} coupled with increased 5-{HT}3 receptor responsiveness may result in enhanced dopamine transmission in the reward pathway, a predictor of increased risk for addiction. Our results may have pharmacogenetic implications for 5-{HT}3 therapeutic antagonists such as ondansetron.},

	abstract = {Although very many individuals drink alcohol at safe levels, a significant proportion escalates their consumption with addiction as the end result. Alcoholism is a common, moderately heritable, psychiatric disorder that is accompanied by considerable morbidity and mortality. Variation in clinical presentation suggests inter-individual variation in mechanisms of vulnerability including genetic risk factors. The development of addiction is likely to involve numerous functional genetic variants of small effects. The first part of this review will focus on genetic factors underlying inter-individual variability in response to alcohol consumption, including variants in alcohol metabolizing genes that produce an aversive response (the flushing syndrome) and variants that predict the level of subjective and physiological response to alcohol. The second part of this review will report on genetic variants that identify subgroups of alcoholics who are more likely to respond to pharmacotherapy to reduce levels of drinking or maintain abstinence. Genetic analyses of the level of response to alcohol, particularly of the functional {OPRM}1 A118G polymorphism and 5' and 3' functional polymorphisms in {SLC}6A4, are beginning to provide insights into the etiology of alcoholism and also genotype-stratified subgroup responses to naltrexone and {SSRIs}/ondansetron respectively. Because of large inter-ethnic variation in allele frequencies, the relevance of these functional polymorphisms will vary between ethnic groups. However there are relatively few published studies in this field, particularly with large sample sizes in pharmacogenetic studies, therefore it is premature to draw any conclusions at this stage.},

{AREAS} {COVERED}: This article focuses on current pharmacological treatment approaches for alcohol dependence, which have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials ({RCTs}).
{EXPERT} {OPINION}: Besides the opioid system modulator nalmefene, which has recently been approved as a medication for the reduction of alcohol consumption, several compounds have been investigated in patients with alcohol dependence using a randomized, placebo-controlled design. In these studies, the antiepileptic drugs topiramate and gabapentin were found to be effective in improving several drinking-related outcomes, whereas levetiracetam failed to show efficacy in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Clinical studies using (low-dose) baclofen, a selective {GABA}-B receptor agonist, produced conflicting results, so that results of further trials are needed. Varenicline has also shown mixed results in two {RCTs}, but might possibly be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence. The α1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin is currently under investigation in alcohol dependence with and without comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ({PTSD}). Finally, first clinical evidence suggests that the 5-{HT}3 antagonist ondansetron might possibly be used in future within a pharmacogenetic treatment approach in alcohol dependence.},

As a result of this heterogeneity, there is no one treatment for {AUD} that will work for everyone. During the past 2 decades, efforts have been made to develop a menu of medications to give patients and clinicians more choices when seeking a therapy that is both effective and which has limited side effects. To date, 3 medications have been approved by the {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA}) to treat alcohol dependence: disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. In addition to these approved medications, researchers have identified new therapeutic targets and, as a result, a number of alternative medications are now being evaluated for treatment of {AUD} in human studies. Although not approved by the {FDA} for the treatment of {AUD}, in some cases, these alternative medications are being used off-label by clinicians for this purpose. These potential medications are reviewed here. They include nalmefene, varenicline, gabapentin, topiramate, zonisamide, baclofen, ondansetron, levetiracetam, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effectiveness of these medications has been mixed-some show good efficacy with side effects that are mild to moderate in intensity; others have mixed or promising results but are awaiting findings from ongoing studies; and still others show poor efficacy, despite promising preliminary results. Medications development remains a high priority. Key initiatives for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ({NIAAA}) include supporting the discovery and development of more effective and safer medications, advancing the field of personalized medicine, and forging public and private partnerships to investigate new and more effective compounds.},

	abstract = {Alcohol addiction is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder according to both phenotype and etiology. Difference in phenotype characteristics manifests in the manner the addiction arises, history of the alcoholic and history of drinking, comorbid disorders, and the phenomenon of abstinence difficulties. Concerning the etiology of alcoholism, the disease itself is considered to be a consequence of an interactive influence of the environment and genetic factors. Numerous researches conducted in the last decades discovered many aspects of the biochemical, cell and molecular bases of alcohol addiction, leading to a conclusion that alcoholism is, like many other addictions, a brain disease. By recognizing alcoholism as a disease which basically implies changes of the neurobiological mechanisms, as well as a clear genetic basis, it was supposed that the disease, having its basis solely in the symptomatology, is essentially heterogeneous. By trying to solve the problem of a clinically heterogeneous nature of the disease during the last fifty years, various sub-classifications of such patients have been suggested. According to Cloninger, subtypes of alcoholism differ also according to changes in the brain neurotransmission systems, i.e. it is supposed that patients suffering from alcoholism type 1 have a more pronounced dopaminergic transmission deficit, while dopaminergic transmission is not disturbed significantly in patients diagnosed with alcoholism type 2, who, however, have a significant lack of serotonergic transmission. In such a way, Cloninger actually presented the basis of the so-called neurobiological alcoholism model. Since he has connected differences in neurotransmission with differences in personality characteristics, this model is also known as the psychobiological model of alcoholism. The characteristic of alcoholism type 1 is avoiding damage (Harm Avoidance, {HA}) decreased dopamine transmission and increased serotonin transmission, while the significant characteristic of alcoholism type 2 is seeking for excitement (Novelty Seeking, {NS}), unchanged dopamine transmission and decreased serotonin transmission. These neurochemical differences among alcoholism subtypes represent the basis for a different therapy approach. Intake of alcohol changes different gene expression in the human brain. The inheritance model of alcoholism is not fully explained, however, it is considered that the disease is connected to a larger gene number included in neurotransmission, cell mechanisms and general metabolic function, with a simultaneous influence of the environment. The contribution of genetic factors is stronger in certain types of alcoholism and thus we have been confronted in the last years of alcoholism research with studies researching the connections of some alcoholism subtypes with the polymorphism phenomenon in the genes coding the synaptic proteins included in the alcoholism etiology. The primary role of monoamine oxidase ({MAO}) in the brain is catalysis of deamination of the oxidative neurotransmitter amines, i.e. serotonin, adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine. Thus, this enzyme is the key factor for maintaining cytoplasmic concentration of various neurotransmitters and for regulation of the neurotransmitting synaptic activity. Taken this {MAO} function into consideration, {MAO} is the enzyme included in the etiology and pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The finding of the decreased platelet {MAO} activity in various psychiatric disorders has brought us to the assumption that this enzyme may be a constitutional/genetic indicator (trait marker) or an indicator of disease condition (state marker) in biologic psychiatry. There are only a few studies of alcohol addiction researching the connections of the {MAO} coding gene polymorphism and alcoholism; however, these studies are primarily related to the variable number of tandem repeats ({VTNR}) polymorphism in the regulatory gene region for {MAO}-A, considered to influence the transcription activity/functionality of the enzyme.},

	abstract = {The consequences of alcohol dependence concern serious health care, social and economic problems. The scope of many studies is to better understand mechanisms underlying alcohol addiction in order to work out new, more effective treatment strategies. Alcohol affects many neurotransmission systems within the brain. In general, acute alcohol enhances inhibitory transmission, up-regulating the {GABAergic} system and impairing glutamatergic function, therefore interfering the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Chronic alcohol consumption, meanwhile, in order to restore equilibrium leads to neuroadaptive changes caus- ing both decreased {GABAergic} and increased glutamatergic activity. Also function of other neurotransmitters and modulators is modified by the presence of alcohol, including glycine, adenosine, serotonin and dopamine. Moreover, a significant impact of alcohol on the endogenous opioid system, nicotinic cholinergic transmission and the endocannabinoids system has been also established. At present, only four medications are approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in Europe, that is naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram and the most recent nalmefene. Among other promising strategies the following drugs are mentioned: baclofen, topiramate, ondansetron, aripiprazole, rimonabant and varenicline. Additionally, the role of appetite-regulating hormones, neuroimmune modulators or the body's stress-response system modulators in reducing alcohol consumption is currently of great interest, however, further investigations are needed.},

Since the frequency of alleles associated with pharmacotherapy for {AUD} varies by ancestral background, the effectiveness of medications used to treat {AUD} may vary among different populations. The purpose of this review is to summarize the existing pharmacogenetic studies of treatments for {AUD} in individuals of European, East Asian, African, and American Indian/Alaska Native ancestry.
{METHODS}: Electronic databases were searched for pharmacogenetic studies of {AUD} treatment that included individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds.
{RESULTS}: Pharmacogenetic studies of {AUD} reviewed here have primarily investigated genetic variation thought to play a role in the response to naltrexone, ondansetron, and topiramate. There is support that the A118G polymorphism should be further investigated in individuals of East Asian ancestry.
{DISCUSSION} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}: Given the lack of pharmacogenetic research on response to {AUD} medication in ethnic minority populations and the mixed results, there is a critical need for future studies among individuals of different ancestries. More efforts should be devoted to standardizing procedures such that results can be more readily integrated into a body of literature that can directly inform clinical practice.
{SCIENTIFIC} {SIGNIFICANCE}: This review highlights the importance for future research to aim for inclusiveness in pharmacogenetic studies of {AUD} and increase diversity of clinical trials in order to provide the best treatment outcomes for individuals across different racial and ethnic groups.

This matched case-control study investigates the effect of a multidisciplinary criteria-led discharge protocol for uncomplicated appendicitis in children.
{METHODS}: Key protocol components included limiting post-operative antibiotics to two intravenous doses, avoidance of intravenous opioid analgesia, prompt resumption of diet, active encouragement of early ambulation and nursing staff autonomy to discharge patients that met assigned criteria. The study period was from August 2015 to February 2016. Outcomes were compared with a historical control group matched for operative approach.
{RESULTS}: Outcomes for 83 patients enrolled to our protocol were compared with those of 83 controls. There was a 29.2\% reduction in median post-operative length of stay in our protocol-based care group (19.6 versus 27.7 h; P {\textless} 0.001). The rate of discharges within 24 h improved from 12 to 42\%. There was no significant difference in complication rate (4.8 versus 7.2\%; P = 0.51). Mean oral morphine dose equivalent per kilogram requirement was less than half (46\%) that of control group patients (P {\textless} 0.001). Mean number of ondansetron doses was also significantly lower. Projected annual direct cost savings following protocol implementation was {AUD}\$77 057.
{CONCLUSION}: Implementation of a criteria-led discharge protocol at our hospital decreased length of stay, reduced variation in care, preserved existing low morbidity, incurred substantial cost savings, and safely rationalized opioid and antiemetic medication.

Supervised disulfiram is a second-line treatment approach. Compounds developed and licensed for different neuropsychiatric disorders are potential alternatives. Encouraging results have been reported for topiramate, gabapentin and also varenicline, which might be useful in patients with comorbid nicotine dependence. The {GABA} (γ-aminobutyric acid)-B receptor agonist baclofen has shown mixed results; it is currently licensed for the treatment of {AUDs} in France only.

Currently, there is limited literature on the pharmacotherapeutic interventions for {AUD} in the Indian setting. It is imperative to identify the possible variations in their effects from Western studies, and hence the current review was attempted to perform a comprehensive evaluation and critical appraisal of the methodology of the evidence on pharmacological strategies of relapse prevention of {AUD} in the Indian setting. A total of 18 studies were included in the review. Disulfiram was the most common pharmacological agent to be studied. The initial literature before 2000 focused primarily on disulfiram, whereas the studies in the next decade compared it to acamprosate and naltrexone and emerging interest in anticraving agents such as baclofen and topiramate had been noted over the past few years. No studies were available on newer agents such as ondansetron, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or formulations such as depot and implants. Deterrent agents were found to be better when compared to anticraving agents in terms of abstinence and relapse, whereas the latter were more effective for control of craving. Among the pharmacological agents studied, the greatest evidence exists for disulfiram for relapse prevention which could be due to affordability of disulfiram and social support in the Indian context. The chief methodological limitations include the lack of randomized trials and objective measures for assessing abstinence.},

	doi = {10.1007/s40263-017-0484-2},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous reviews have examined the use of theoretically supported combinations of drugs for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. This review seeks to examine the strengths and limitations of current clinical evidence for the use of combined pharmacological interventions intended to treat alcohol use disorder.
{OBJECTIVES}: The objective of this review was to identify combinations of pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder, and assess the strength of clinical evidence for these treatments.
{METHODS}: We conducted searches using {PubMed}, {EMBASE}® through Ovid® (1974 to present), {MEDLINE}® through Ovid® (1946 to present), and Psychinfo® through Ovid® (1806 to present). Our primary search included the terms "alcoholism" and "drug therapy, combination". Search results were restricted to human subjects and English language. Search criteria were not restricted based on study design or patient age. Studies were evaluated for randomization, blinding, group similarity, power determination, outcome reporting, and number of patients analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Nine hundred and eighty-four publications were initially screened for inclusion after duplicates were removed. The search identified 16 publications evaluating drug combinations for the treatment of alcohol use disorder. The majority of published trials included naltrexone combined with one of the following: gabapentin, ondansetron, acamprosate, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, sertraline, quetiapine, or escitalopram plus gamma-hydroxybutyrate. Other combinations included 5-hydroxytryptophan with carbidopa/levodopa, gamma-hydroxybutyrate with disulfiram, acamprosate with disulfiram, and mirtazapine with quetiapine. Interpretation of results across studies was limited by low statistical power, and heterogeneity of drug combinations and outcome measures. Drug combination effect sizes were comparable to those observed in single-agent trials.
{CONCLUSIONS}: No significant benefit for the use of combinations over single agents was observed. However, benefit may be observed when combined pharmacological interventions address specific symptoms of alcohol use disorder known to be influenced by combination components, or when combinations are used in specific subpopulations in which combination components demonstrate benefit.},

	abstract = {Subtyping alcoholics may provide a more accurate guide as to the course and character of the disease. Classifications of different ages of onset of problem drinking have so far resulted in categorical inconsistencies. In the past, hospital-based alcoholics have over-represented those most severely ill, and comprehensive evaluations of psychopathology for discriminating between alcoholic subtypes have been infrequent. In a heterogeneous treatment-seeking, outpatient, alcoholic population, we tested the hypothesis that age of onset represents a continuum of disease, and that greater severity of psychopathology is associated with lower ages of onset. Using a standard questionnaire, 253 male and female treatment-seeking alcoholics were stratified according to specific ages of onset: a) {\textless} 20 years; b) 20-25 years, and c) {\textgreater} 25 years. These age of onset groups were compared on alcohol severity and craving, family history, childhood behavior, personality, hostility, overt aggression, mood, and social functioning. Symptom severity and age of onset were negatively correlated, and the 20-25-year onset group usually had intermediate scores. The {\textless} 20 year onset group was characterized by greater severity of alcohol-related problems, family history, childhood behavioral problems, craving, hostility, antisocial traits, mood disturbance, and poor social functioning. Alcoholics with an earlier age of onset have relatively greater psychopathology than those of later onset. While the preponderance of psychopathology among those in the {\textless} 20-year onset group could be conceptualized as a clinical "subtype," such a characterization would not define an entirely homogeneous category. Yet, this clinical characterization would be clinically important if specific age of onset levels were found to be differentially sensitive to pharmacological and/or psychological treatments.},

	abstract = {The chemistry, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, stability, compatibility, and dosage of ondansetron hydrochloride are described, and clinical studies of the use of ondansetron for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting induced by antineoplastic therapy are reviewed. Ondansetron hydrochloride is a specific antagonist of serotonin type 3 (5-{HT}3) receptors, both in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and in the {GI} tract. Peak plasma concentrations of ondansetron occur approximately one hour after an oral dose and 6 to 20 minutes after an i.v. dose. The mean elimination half-life is approximately 3.5 hours in healthy volunteers, but it is extended in elderly patients (mean of 7.9 hours). In clinical trials, ondansetron has been shown to provide excellent control of nausea and vomiting in patients treated with cisplatin. Comparisons of ondansetron with metoclopramide in patients treated with various types of chemotherapy have shown better response rates with ondansetron. Ondansetron has also been shown to be effective in controlling nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cyclophosphamide with an anthracycline and in patients receiving combination therapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Adverse effects appear to be mild and include headache, constipation, diarrhea and transient abnormalities in liver function tests. The dose of ondansetron (as the hydrochloride salt) for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults is 0.15 mg/kg i.v. every four hours for three doses, beginning 30 minutes before antineoplastic therapy. The efficacy of ondansetron is comparable to that of metoclopramide, and the adverse-effect profile is much less problematic. The cost of ondansetron is much higher than that of metoclopramide; thus its use should be limited to patients at high risk for metoclopramide-induced adverse effects and patients in whom metoclopramide is ineffective.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The authors previously reported that the 5'-{HTTLPR}-{LL} and rs1042173-{TT} ({SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT}) genotypes in the serotonin transporter gene predicted a significant reduction in the severity of alcohol consumption among alcoholics receiving the 5-{HT}3 antagonist ondansetron. In this study, they explored additional markers of ondansetron treatment response in alcoholics by examining polymorphisms in the {HTR}3A and {HTR}3B genes, which regulate directly the function and binding of 5-{HT}3 receptors to ondansetron.
{METHOD}: The authors genotyped one rare and 18 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in {HTR}3A and {HTR}3B in the same sample that they genotyped for {SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT} in the previous randomized, double-blind, 11-week clinical trial. Participants were 283 European Americans who received oral ondansetron (4 mg/kg of body weight twice daily) or placebo along with weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy. Associations of individual and combined genotypes with treatment response on drinking outcomes were analyzed.
{RESULTS}: Individuals carrying one or more of genotypes rs1150226-{AG} and rs1176713-{GG} in {HTR}3A and rs17614942-{AC} in {HTR}3B showed a significant overall mean difference between ondansetron and placebo in drinks per drinking day (22.50; effect size=0.867), percentage of heavy drinking days (220.58\%; effect size=0.780), and percentage of days abstinent (18.18\%; effect size=0.683). Combining these {HTR}3A/{HTR}3B and {SLC}6A4-{LL}/{TT} genotypes increased the target cohort from approaching 20\% (identified in the previous study) to 34\%.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The authors present initial evidence suggesting that a combined fivemarker genotype panel can be used to predict the outcome of treatment of alcohol dependence with ondansetron. Additional, larger pharmacogenetic studies would help to validate these results.},

Because the serotonin transporter (5-{HTT}) is an important regulator of neuronal 5-{HT} function, allelic differences at that gene may modulate the severity of alcohol consumption and predict therapeutic response to the 5-{HT}(3) receptor antagonist, ondansetron.
{METHOD}: The authors randomized 283 alcoholics by genotype in the 5'-regulatory region of the 5-{HTT} gene ({LL}/{LS}/{SS}), with additional genotyping for another functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (T/G), rs1042173, in the 3'-untranslated region, in a double-blind controlled trial. Participants received either ondansetron (4 μg/kg twice daily) or placebo for 11 weeks, plus standardized cognitive-behavioral therapy.
{RESULTS}: Individuals with the {LL} genotype who received ondansetron had a lower mean number of drinks per drinking day (-1.62) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (11.27\%) than those who received placebo. Among ondansetron recipients, the number of drinks per drinking day was lower (-1.53) and the percentage of days abstinent higher (9.73\%) in {LL} compared with {LS}/{SS} individuals. {LL} individuals in the ondansetron group also had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-1.45) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (9.65\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined. For both number of drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, 5'-{HTTLPR} and rs1042173 variants interacted significantly. {LL}/{TT} individuals in the ondansetron group had a lower number of drinks per drinking day (-2.63) and a higher percentage of days abstinent (16.99\%) than all other genotype and treatment groups combined.

The 5-{HT}3 receptor antagonists that are substituted tropines, {ICS} 205-930 (0.1–0.56 mg/kg) and {MDL} 72222 (3.0–17.0 mg/kg), blocked ethanol-appropriate responding, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that some of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol are mediated via the 5-{HT}3 receptor. The blockade the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol occurred in the presence of approximately 25–40 {mM} blood ethanol levels. Furthermore, the ethanol dose-effect function was shifted to the right by increasing doses of {MDL} 72222, suggesting a surmountable antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. However, the benzamide zacopride (0.56–1.7 mg/kg), which is also a 5-{HT}3 receptor antagonist, did not block the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. In addition, the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol and the 5-{HT}2 receptor antagonist ketanserin also failed to block the ethanol discrimination. The results suggest that 5-{HT}3 mediated neurotransmission is an important component of ethanol's discriminative stimulus effects, but that the structural characteristics of the selective 5-{HT}3 receptor antagonists influence their ability to block this action of ethanol. Furthermore, these findings implicate a significant role of 5-{HT}3 activity in the behavioral effects of ethanol that may provide a pharmacological means for therapeutic intervention of alcohol abuse.},

	abstract = {Recent studies indicate that ethanol ({EtOH}) potentiates ion current through the channel associated with the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-{HT}3)-type serotonin receptor. The present study was designed to determine 1) whether such potentiation occurs in adult mammalian neurons expressing 5-{HT}3 receptors; 2) whether potentiation is selective for the 5-{HT}3 receptor, relative to other ligand-gated ion channels; and 3) possible mechanisms by which {EtOH} potentiates this response. {EtOH} potentiated 5-{HT}3 receptor-mediated ion current in freshly isolated nodose ganglion neurons at concentrations similar to those previously reported to be effective in neuroblastoma cells (25-100 {mM}). Current was blocked by the selective 5-{HT}3 antagonist {ICS} 205-930 even in the presence of {EtOH}, and current activated by a 5-{HT}3 agonist (2-methyl-5-{HT}) was potentiated by {EtOH}. Thus, {EtOH} appears to produce potentiation via an alteration in the function of 5-{HT}3 receptors and not through an independent effect. gamma-Aminobutyric {acidA} receptor-mediated Cl- current was not potentiated by {EtOH} in neurons in which potentiation of responses to 5-{HT} was observed. Methanol potentiated 5-{HT}3 receptor-mediated current with a potency lower than that of {EtOH}. Potentiation by {EtOH} decreased with increasing 5-{HT} concentration. In addition, {EtOH} increased the decay rate of current. {EtOH} did not alter the reversal potential of the 5-{HT}3 receptor-mediated current. These observations indicate that intoxicating concentrations of {EtOH} selectively potentiate 5-{HT}3 receptor-mediated responses by increasing the apparent potency of 5-{HT} for activating ion current.},

Drugs abused by humans (e.g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused.},

	abstract = {The effects of acute {IP} administration (0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g/kg) and local perfusion (25, 50 or 100 {mM}) of ethanol on the extracellular concentrations of dopamine ({DA}), serotonin (5-{HT}) and their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens ({ACC}) of the rat were studied with in vivo microdialysis coupled with a small-bore {HPLC} electrochemical detection procedure. The {IP} administration of 1.0 and 2.0 g/kg ethanol significantly (p{\textless}0.05) increased the extracellular levels of {DA} and 5-{HT} in the {ACC} whereas the 0.5 g/kg dose caused no change. In general, the extracellular levels of the 3 monoamine metabolites were not altered by {IP} ethanol except for a slight increase in the levels of homovanillic acid following the 2.0 g/kg dose. Local perfusion of 50 and 100 {mM} ethanol (but not 25 {mM}) through the microdialysis probe markedly increased (170–200\% of control) the extracellular levels of {DA} in the {ACC}. Only the 100 {mM} concentration of ethanol altered the extracellular levels of 5-{HT} (2-fold increase), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Addition of 100 μM {ICS} 205–930 (a 5-{HT}3 antagonist) to the perfusate markedly reduced the 100 {mM} ethanol-stimulated release of {DA} and 5-{HT}. Overall, the data suggest that ethanol can stimulate the release of both {DA} and 5-{HT} in the {ACC} and that the action of ethanol within the {ACC} may be mediated in part by 5-{HT}3 receptors.},

	abstract = {The effect of the i.p. administration of ethanol on the release of dopamine ({DA}) and on the output of its main metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, was estimated in the rat by transcerebral dialysis of two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal caudate. Low doses of ethanol (0.25-0.5 g/kg i.p.) stimulated {DA} release specifically in the n. accumbens and elicited pure behavioral stimulation. Higher doses of ethanol (1.0-2.5 g/kg) elicited sedation and hypnosis and stimulated further {DA} release and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid output in the accumbens and, although less, also in the caudate. High doses of ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) elicited long-lasting hypnosis and sedation and induced a depression followed by stimulation of {DA} release in the accumbens. {DA} release in the caudate was stimulated further. Low doses of apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) reversed completely the stimulant effect of 0.5 g/kg of ethanol on behavior and on {DA} release in the accumbens. Moreover, the stimulation of behavior and of {DA} release in the accumbens elicited by 0.5 g/kg of ethanol were abolished completely by pretreatment with 700 mg/kg of gamma-butyrolactone, an agent which blocks {DA} firing and {DA} release. The results indicate that ethanol preferentially stimulates {DA} transmission in the mesolimbic system probably by activating the firing activity of mesolimbic {DA} neurons and provide direct evidence that these changes are involved in the motor stimulant effects of ethanol.},

	abstract = {Dopaminergic systems are thought to play a major role in the stimulant and reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol. The present study describes the effects of local perfusion with ethanol (and other alcohols) on extracellular dopamine in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. Following the establishment of basal dopamine levels (2–3 h), various concentrations of ethanol in artificial {CSF} (0.01–10\% v/v) were slowly perfused through a microdialysis probe. Each dose of ethanol was found to increase dopamine concentrations in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens. This increase was dose-related in the striatum. The exclusion of calcium and inclusion of 12.5 {mM} magnesium in the perfusion medium prevented, or greatly attenuated the ethanol-induced dopamine ({DA}) release. Thus, the release of {DA} by ethanol is exocytotic in nature and involves calcium-dependent processes. The other alcohols tested, namely methanol and butanol, demonstrated a structure-activity relationship together with ethanol, in their ability to increase extracellular {DA}. The relative potency was butanol {\textgreater} ethanol {\textgreater} methanol. The diffusion of ethanol into the brain tissue was investigated following perfusion through the probe. Relatively low concentrations of ethanol were found in striatal tissue during perfusion and they declined rapidly with time, following the removal of ethanol from the perfusate. The concentrations of ethanol achieved in brain tissue following focal application through the microdialysis probe were relevant to human intoxication.},

The clustering solution identified two "types" of alcoholics who differed consistently across 17 defining characteristics in the male and female samples. One group, designated type A alcoholics, is characterized by later onset, fewer childhood risk factors, less severe dependence, fewer alcohol-related problems, and less psychopathological dysfunction. The other group, termed type B alcoholics, is characterized by childhood risk factors, familial alcoholism, early onset of alcohol-related problems, greater severity of dependence, polydrug use, a more chronic treatment history (despite their younger age), greater psychopathological dysfunction, and more life stress. The two types also differed with respect to treatment outcome assessed prospectively at 12 and 36 months. The results are consistent with historical and contemporary typological theories that have postulated similar subgroups of alcoholics. The findings suggest that an empirically derived, multivariate typology of alcoholism has theoretical implications for explaining the heterogeneity among alcoholics and may provide a useful basis for predicting course and estimating treatment response.}",

Consistent with previous cluster analysis research, indicators of risk for alcoholism, alcohol dependence, drinking history, and psychopathological impairment distinguished alcoholics along two broad dimensions of vulnerability and severity, with one subtype (type B alcoholics) manifesting an earlier onset of problem drinking, more familial alcoholism, greater dependence on alcohol, and more symptoms of antisocial personality than the other subtype (type A alcoholics). Analyses of outcome indicated that type A alcoholics fared better in interactional treatment and more poorly with coping skills training. Conversely, type B alcoholics had better outcomes with the coping skills treatment and worse outcomes with interactional therapy.
