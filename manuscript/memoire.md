## Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex, chronic condition influenced by neurobiological, genetic, and environmental factors. While medications like acamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram have shown efficacy, treatment responses vary among patients, underscoring the importance of personalized therapy. Pharmacogenetics has identified distinct AUD subgroups based on genetic variations, highlighting the need for tailored treatment approaches.

Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has shown promise as a pharmacotherapy for AUD. Initially used as an antiemetic, ondansetron's impact on the brain's reward system, particularly in relation to alcohol's effects, led to its evaluation in AUD. Clinical studies in healthy male volunteers indicated its potential to reduce alcohol's reinforcing properties by blocking 5-HT3 receptors. Subsequent phase 2 trials suggested differential effects based on age of AUD onset, with ondansetron showing reduced drinking and craving in early-onset patients only.

Pharmacogenetic studies have further explored the role of 5-HTT genotype in AUD treatment response, with evidence suggesting ondansetron's efficacy among certain genotypes. By targeting specific genetic profiles, ondansetron may offer a personalized approach to treating AUD and reducing alcohol consumption and craving.

Understanding the impact of 5-HT antagonists on AUD, alongside patient subtypes and genetic predictors of treatment response, is crucial for improving treatment strategies and advancing personalized medicine in AUD pharmacotherapy. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron on alcohol consumption and craving, as well as the clinical and genetic factors influencing treatment response.

## Methods
## 2.1 Research design
The study consisted of a systematic review of the literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [35].
## 2.2. Databases and search strategy
## 2.2 Databases and Search Strategy

This review utilized the following databases: PUBMED/MEDLINE, Psychinfo, Cochrane, and Wiley Online Library. The search was conducted for all years up to November, 2024.

The following search terms were employed:

In the Medline search, relevant articles were identified by combining the terms:
```
("ondansetron"[MeSH Terms] OR "ondansetron"[All Fields]) AND ("alcoholism"[MeSH Terms] OR "alcoholism"[All Fields] OR "alcohol use disorder"[All Fields] OR "alcohol abuse"[All Fields] OR "AUD"[All Fields])
```

For the Wiley Online Library search, we utilized the keywords `"ondansetron" AND "alcoholism"`.

In the PsycInfo search, the keywords were `"ondansetron or zofran" AND "alcoholism or alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse or alcoholic or alcohol addiction"`.

Lastly, the Cochrane Library was accessed by searching `("alcohol use disorder" OR "alcohol dependance") AND "ondansetron" in "Title Abstract Keyword"`.
## 2.3. Eligibility criteria
## 2.3 Eligibility criteria

Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria:
- Published in a peer-reviewed journal
- Involving individuals with AUD, without restrictions based on age, gender, ethnicity, or location
- Examining the effects of ondansetron on AUD and/or factors predicting response to ondansetron treatment
- Written in English

Studies were excluded if they were:
- Preclinical studies, reviews, opinion papers, protocols, or case reports
- Animal studies
- Studies involving healthy volunteers
- Not published in English
## 2.4. Study selection
## 2.4. Study selection

Two authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts. Relevant articles were retrieved in full-text and evaluated for inclusion criteria separately by the two reviewers, following the predefined criteria. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and consensus was reached. Additionally, the reference lists of key papers were manually checked to guarantee a thorough review. All included studies were carefully examined to validate their alignment with the inclusion criteria, study type, and study population.
## 2.5. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
## 2.5. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study using the revised Cochrane tool for evaluating risk of bias in randomized trials (RoB 2; Sterne et al., 2019), following the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration. The risk-of-bias plot in Figure 2 was created using the Robvis online tool (McGuinness et al., 2020). Judgments of high risk, low risk, or unclear (due to insufficient information or uncertainty regarding bias potential) were assigned. Any disagreements between authors were resolved through consensus, with a third author consulted if needed.

For single-arm non-randomized studies, the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS; Peterson et al., 2011) was utilized with the modification of removing the Comparability item for two studies that did not have a control group.
## 2.6. Collecting data
2.6. Data Collection

Sample characteristics, including socio-demographic data and comorbidity information, as well as details on study design, methods of assessment of clinical outcomes, and treatment dosage, were extracted.

Results
## 3.1. Study selection
A total of 90 results were found in the MEDLINE database, 68 in PsycInfo, 35 in the Cochrane Library, and an additional 8 studies were found on Wiley Online Library, resulting in a total of 134 articles identified through the database searches. After reviewing the full text, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. This selection process is outlined in the PRISMA flowchart (see Figure 1). Among the 21 included studies, 18 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or analyses of previous RCTs, and 3 were prospective open-label studies (Kranzler et al., 2003; Dawes et al., 2005a; Dawes et al., 2005b). The study durations ranged from 2 to 12 weeks, and the selected articles were published between 1994 and 2015.
## 3.2. Quality and risk of bias assessment
## 3.2. Quality and Risk of Bias Assessment

Randomized controlled trials were analyzed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool (refer to Figure 2 for the traffic-light plot). Two studies had a low concern of bias ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3], [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron]), while most of the studies showed some concern of bias and one had a high concern ([@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose]). The high dropout rate in the studies was the most concerning factor, affecting Domain 3 of the Risk of Bias tool, which represents bias due to missing outcome results. For the three prospective studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used (see Figure 6). The risk of bias was considered acceptable, as one study scored 7 out of 9 possible points, and the other two scored 6 out of 7 (adapted score).
## 3.3. Study results
Results are presented based on their primary outcomes. Of the 21 studies included, 11 assessed odansetron efficacy on alcohol use, while some focused on craving and mood effects. Additionally, X studies explored factors that influenced treatment outcomes. The first group of studies (Tables 2, 3, and 4) looked at alcohol use, craving, and mood disturbances as indicators of odansetron efficacy, while the second set (Table 5) analyzed moderators of treatment outcomes.
### 3.3.1 Sample characteristics

The included studies involved 11 distinct study populations whom characteristics are described in **Table 1.**

<!-- TODO: UPDATE VALUES-->
In total, !1088 subjects were enrolled, of which !1071 !(%) met criteria for alcohol use disorder. Patients were mostly males !n= ;!75.3 % with a mean age of !41.0 years.

Patients enrolled were diagnosed as alcohol dependent according to the DSM-III-TR ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking]), DSM-IV ([@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly], [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial], [@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin]), DSM-IV-TR ([@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic]), DSM-5 ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]) or ICD-10 ([@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose]). Some studies required additional criteria, such as more than 35 standard drinks per week for men or 28 for women ([@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic]), more than 30 drinks per week for men or 21 for women ([@seneviratne2012SerotoninTransporterGenomic]), at least 15 standard drinks in the week before enrollement ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]), more than 3 standard drinks per day and a Michigan Alcohol Screening Test greater than 5 ([@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea]), an AUDIT score greater than 8 ([@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin]) or a diagnosis before the age of 25 ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]). Whereas most trials ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly], [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial]) concerned treatment-seeking patients, some ([@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron], [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic]) did not. Drug use and disorder was considered as an exclusion criteria in most included studies. Thus, participants who reported drug use ([@kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly], [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron], [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic]) and/or had a positive drug screening test ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron], [@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose]) were often excluded, except for cannabis use in a few trials ([@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial], [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron]). Receipt of alcohol use disorder treatment prior to enrollment was an exclusion criteria; one study ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3]) considered treatment over the previous 12 months, and 3 ([@johnson2000AgeOnsetDiscriminator], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial]) over the previous 30 days.

Some studies excluded participants who had been treated with stimulants, sedatives, hypnotics or with treatment that could have an effect on alcohol consumption or mood ([@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial]). In one study ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]), having been treated with naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram or topiramate 2 weeks prior inclusion, or current treatment with phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicine, apomorphine or tramodol (due to potential interactions with ondansetron) were exclusion criteria.

Psychiatric disorders were exclusion criteria in most studies ([@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea] [@kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly], [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin], [@kenna2014OndansetronSertralineMay]). Two studies considered only major diagnosis ([@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron]) or clinically significant disorders ([@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose] [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial]) as exclusion criteria. In the study of Sellers *et al.* ([@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3]), a Montgomery/Asberg Depression scale score below 15 and a Spielberg State-Trait anxiety inventory score below 55 were required. In contrast, one study ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]) enrolled only people with a concurrent psychiatric diagnosis.

Many studies also required good health at enrollment and notably excluded frequent AUD comorbidities such as elevated bilirubin ([@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment]), liver enzymes ([@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial], [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment]), [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]), liver cirrhosis ([@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose], [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]) or severe alcohol withdrawal ([@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial]) ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]).

Considering participants subtypes, 9 studies ([@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking], [@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@johnson2002OndansetronReducesCraving], [@johnson2003OndansetronReducesMood], [@kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly], [@roache2008PredictionSerotonergicTreatment]), [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]) focused on clinical characteristics based on age of onset, before or after the age of 25 (EOA and LOA, while 6 studies examined patient subtypes according to their genotypes ([@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin], [@seneviratne2012SerotoninTransporterGenomic], [@johnson2013DeterminationGenotypeCombinations], [@kenna2014OndansetronSertralineMay], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic], [@hou2015SubgroupIdentificationPersonalized]). The most frequent investigated gene was SLC6A4, coding for the serotonin transporter that contains a polymorphism in the promoter region, the 5-HTT-linked polymorphic region, with a \"short\" (S) and \"long\" (L). Individuals possessing two long alleles (L/L) have been found to respond differently to serotoninergic treatments than those having either one (L/S) or two (S/S) short alleles. Another allele, rs1042173-TT, also on the serotonine transporter gene predicted a better response to ondansetron on alcohol use. Other genes of interest were HTR3A and HTR3B, which regulate the 5HT3 receptor had polymorphisms which influenced response to ondansetron (rs1150226-AG and rs1176713-GG in HTR3A and rs17614942-AC in HTR3B).

Ondansetron dosage ranged from 1 µg/kg bid (twice a day) to 16 mg per day with the most frequent dosage being 4 µg/kg bid. One study ([@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled]) used a flexible dosage according to treatment response that could range from 0.5 to 4 mg bid (with a mean dose of 3.24 ± 2.64 mg/day).

Four studies ([@johnson2000CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea], [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone], [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron]), involving 127 patients, used ondansetron in combination with naltrexone (50 mg/d). Three studies (n=97 patients) compared ondansetron (0.5 mg/d) to sertraline (200 mg/d) ([@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment], [@kenna2014OndansetronSertralineMay], [@kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic]). Treatment duration ranged from 8 days to 11 weeks. Pill count or riboflavin dosage were used for assessing treatment compliance.

### 3.3.2 Treatment outcomes
### 3.3.2 Treatment outcomes

Efficacy was primarily evaluated by assessing the number of standard drinks and related variables using the Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) method [@sobell1992TimelineFollowBack]. Key drinking outcomes included drinks per day (DD), drinks per drinking day (DDD), percentage of days abstinent (PDA), heavy drinking days (days with more than 5 drinks per day), and percentage of heavy drinking days (PHDD). The definition of a standard drink varied across studies, with some using 12 g [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking; @johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin], others using 13 g [@sellers1994ClinicalEfficacy5HT3], and some using 14 g [@correafilho2013PilotStudyFulldose] of pure ethanol. Additionally, eight studies utilized objective measures of alcohol use, such as carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (CDT) [@johnson2000OndansetronReductionDrinking; @ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexone; @kranzler2003EffectsOndansetronEarly; @brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled], or the volume of alcohol consumed during self-administration [@kenna2009WithinGroupDesignNontreatment; @kenna2014OndansetronSertralineMay; @kenna2014OndansetronReducesNaturalistic], with one study using $\gamma$-glutamyltransferase [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled].

X studies investigated the effects of ondansetron on alcohol craving. Some studies [@ait-daoud2001CombiningOndansetronNaltrexonea; @johnson2002OndansetronReducesCraving; @myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron] assessed alcohol craving using visual analog scales, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) [@anton1996ObsessiveCompulsiveDrinking], and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). One study [@dawes2005ReductionsRelationsCraving] utilized the Adolescent Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (A-OCDS), while another [@myrick2008EffectNaltrexoneOndansetron] used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure ventral striatum activation during cue exposure and assess cue-induced craving.

Moreover, two studies examined the effects of ondansetron on mood. One study [@johnson2003OndansetronReducesMood] employed the Profile of Mood States [@Mcnair1989ProfileOM] to evaluate mood disturbance attenuation, while another study [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled] utilized the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-report (IDS-SR).
### 3.3.3 Effects of ondansetron on alcohol use reduction
Eleven studies summarized in Table 2 evaluated the effects of ondansetron, either alone or in conjunction with naltrexone, on alcohol use reduction. The primary outcomes mainly consisted of self-reported changes in alcohol consumption using the TLFB method, plasma CDT levels (Johnson et al., 2000; Ait-Daoud et al., 2001; Kranzler et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2021), GGT levels (Brown et al., 2021), or the amount of alcohol consumed during self-administration (Kenna et al., 2009; Kenna et al., 2014; Kenna et al., 2014).

In a study of 71 males with alcohol dependence (DSM-III-TR), Sellers et al. (1994) demonstrated a significant reduction in alcohol use with ondansetron, particularly at a lower dose of 0.25 mg/day, when excluding patients who initially drank more than 10 drinks per day.

A randomized controlled trial (Johnson et al., 2000) with 20 participants investigated the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone in early-onset alcoholics, showing a significant reduction in drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and a trend towards fewer abstinent days compared to a placebo.

Subsequent analysis by Ait-Daoud et al. (2001) revealed that the ondansetron and naltrexone combination was linked to significantly lower CDT levels.

In a trial conducted outside of North America, Corrêa Filho et al. (2013) reported a significant decrease in heavy drinking days (7.8% vs. 11.7%, p=0.02) but did not observe improvements in other alcohol-related clinical outcomes.

### 3.3.4. Effects of ondansetron on alcohol use reduction according to patient subtypes

**EOA vs LOA**

In a later trial (Johnson et al., 2000), the efficacy of ondansetron was examined based on patient subtypes (Early Onset Alcoholism vs Late Onset Alcoholism) among a sub-sample of 271 patients. Ondansetron was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing alcohol consumption among Early Onset Alcoholism patients but not Late Onset Alcoholism patients. Patients receiving ondansetron at 4 µg/kg twice daily showed a greater reduction in drinks per day (1.56 vs 3.30, p = 0.01), drinks per drinking day (4.28 vs 6.90, p = 0.004), percentage of days abstinent (70.10 vs 50.20, p = 0.02) and mean log CDT ratio (-0.19 vs 0.12, p = 0.01). Among Early Onset Alcoholism patients, all other dosages were also superior to placebo on the first two criteria. These results were subsequently replicated by Kranzler et al. in 2003, who demonstrated a significant reduction in various alcohol-related measures among both Early Onset Alcoholism and Late Onset Alcoholism patients who received ondansetron (4 µg/kg twice daily). Furthermore, significant differences were found in the reduction of drinks per day, drinks per drinking day, and total DrinC score among Early Onset Alcoholism patients. Changes in levels of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin correlated with changes in self-reported drinking behavior.

**Patient genotypes**

In a randomized controlled trial, Johnson et al. (2011) randomized 283 patients based on genotype in the 5\'-regulatory region of the 5-HTT gene (LL/LS/SS). Individuals with the L/L genotype who received ondansetron showed significant reductions in alcohol consumption, as indicated by drinks per drinking day and percentage of days abstinent, compared to those who received placebo (respectively -1.62, p = 0.007 and 11.27%, p = 0.023).

Two other studies investigated treatment response based on the L/L genotype using a self-administration experiment. Kenna et al. (2009) observed that non-treatment seeking individuals with the L/L genotype who were given ondansetron (4 µg/kg twice daily) drank significantly less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration procedure compared to those treated with sertraline (200 mg per day). In another clinical trial involving 77 participants, the same authors provided limited evidence that ondansetron may reduce drinking in non-treatment seeking individuals with the LL genotype. Further analysis highlighted gender differences, with L/L women treated with ondansetron and S/L or S/S women treated with sertraline showing fewer drinks per drinking day and reduced alcohol consumption during a self-administration experiment.

**Alcohol and bipolar disorder participants**

Brown et al. (2021) evaluated the effectiveness of ondansetron in 70 patients with both alcohol use disorder and bipolar disorder. The results showed a trend towards a greater reduction in drinking as measured by the TLFB method, although this did not reach statistical significance.
### 3.3.5. Effects on craving and cue-induced craving
Four studies (see Table 3) examined the effects of ondansetron on craving.

An analysis of the study population by Johnson et al. (2000) found that the combination of ondansetron and naltrexone was significantly more effective than a placebo in reducing craving among early-onset alcoholics. Another study by Johnson et al. (2002) demonstrated that ondansetron at 4 µg/kg *b.i.d.* led to a significant decrease in craving, as measured by a visual analog scale, compared to a placebo group, but only in early-onset alcoholics. On the other hand, craving was found to increase significantly with ondansetron at 1 µg/kg *b.i.d.* among late-onset alcoholics.

In a BOLD-MRI laboratory study conducted by Myrick et al., ventral striatum activation in alcohol use disorder patients during cue exposure was examined according to treatment group (naltrexone, ondansetron, a combination of both, or placebo) and compared to social drinkers. Ventral striatum activation was significantly reduced in the naltrexone, combination, and social drinker groups, and this reduction was associated with a decrease in craving scores. Ondansetron alone did not show significant effectiveness in reducing ventral striatum activation or craving, although there was a trend toward reduction in both.

A study by Sherwood et al. found no significant differences between the ondansetron and placebo groups in patients with both bipolar disorder and alcohol use disorder.
### 3.3.6. Effects on mood disturbances
Two studies investigated the effects of ondansetron medication on mood (see **Table 4**). One study ([@johnson2003OndansetronReducesMood]) found that ondansetron significantly decreased mood disturbances, as measured by the POMS scale, among early abstinent alcoholics. Another study by Sherwood *et al.* [@brown2021RandomizedDoubleblindPlacebocontrolled] demonstrated that ondansetron was more effective than placebo in reducing HRSD scores in patients with both bipolar disorder and AUD, but did not show significant effects on YMRS or IDS-SR scores.
### 3.3.7. Predictors of treatment outcomes
### 3.3.7. Predictors of treatment outcomes

Six studies in **Table 5** provided data on predictors of treatment outcomes.

Ondansetron, previously found effective in early onset alcoholism, was evaluated by Dawes *et al.* [@dawes2005ProspectiveOpenlabelTrial] in adolescents with alcohol dependence. The study showed that ondansetron was safe and well-tolerated, and a subsequent study found a correlation between reduction in drinking and reduction in craving [@dawes2005ReductionsRelationsCraving]. Roache *et al.* 2008 [@roache2008PredictionSerotonergicTreatment] compared the prediction capabilities of typologies and found that the EOA/LOA typology better predicted treatment response to ondansetron compared to the A/B typology.

Seneviratne *et al.* [@seneviratne2012SerotoninTransporterGenomic] suggested that 5'HTTPLR mRNA levels could be used as a biomarker for evaluating treatment effectiveness in L/L-subjects treated with ondansetron.

Two studies analyzed genotypes predicting treatment success identified by Johnson *et al.* 2011 [@johnson2011PharmacogeneticApproachSerotonin], and Johnson *et al.* 2013 [@johnson2013DeterminationGenotypeCombinations] identified genotypes predictive of ondansetron efficacy. Finally, Hou *et al.* [@hou2015SubgroupIdentificationPersonalized] used data mining approaches to simplify subgroup identification and improve prediction of ondansetron effectiveness.

Discussion
==========

The present review is the first systematic assessment of ondansetron for treating alcohol use disorder. Previous research identified five systematic reviews in the last 10 years related to ondansetron and alcohol use disorder or alcoholism. The clinical trials in this review had stringent inclusion criteria, limiting their external validity. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term changes in alcohol consumption and expand inclusion criteria for greater external validity.

Conclusion
==========

While evidence suggests ondansetron's efficacy in treating alcohol use disorder in specific genetic subgroups, further research is necessary. Larger studies addressing long-term outcomes and with broader inclusion criteria are needed for conclusive results.
